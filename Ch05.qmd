Until recently, career success in knowledge work depended heavily on mastering "how" skills - knowing how to build a compelling PowerPoint, how to structure a financial model, or how to write efficient code. But as AI systems become more capable at these technical tasks, the competitive advantage is shifting dramatically toward people who know "what" needs to be done - those who can identify the right problems to solve and strategies to pursue.

This fundamental shift from "how" to "what" has profound implications for businesses, careers, and investment opportunities. Let's explore why this transformation is happening and what it means for different stakeholders.

## The Traditional "How" Advantage

Traditionally, organizations needed large teams of specialists who knew "how" to perform various technical tasks:
- Financial analysts who knew how to build complex Excel models
- Software engineers who knew how to write code in specific languages
- Designers who knew how to use tools like Photoshop
- Writers who knew how to craft clear technical documentation
- Translators who knew how to convert text between languages

These specialists developed their skills through years of practice and training. Their expertise created both job security and earning power - companies were willing to pay premium salaries for people who could execute complex technical tasks effectively.

## AI's Disruption of "How"

Large language models and other AI tools are rapidly getting better at many of these "how" tasks:
- ChatGPT can write basic code in multiple languages
- Midjourney can generate sophisticated images
- Translation tools are approaching human-level quality
- AI assistants can create presentations and documentation

This capability is expanding quickly. Tasks that seemed immune to automation just a few years ago are now being handled competently by AI systems. And unlike human specialists who may take years to master new skills, AI systems can be rapidly retrained or fine-tuned for new capabilities.

## The Rise of "What" Skills

As AI handles more of the "how," competitive advantage shifts to people who excel at determining "what" needs to be done:
- What problems are worth solving?
- What features should a product include?
- What markets should a company enter?
- What strategies will create sustainable advantages?
- What metrics matter most for success?

These "what" decisions require capabilities that current AI systems fundamentally lack:

**Pattern Recognition Across Domains**
Humans can notice subtle patterns and draw insights across seemingly unrelated fields. A business leader might see parallels between consumer behavior in fashion and trends in enterprise software, leading to novel strategic insights. Current AI systems, despite their broad training, struggle to make these creative connections in meaningful ways.

**Judgment Under Uncertainty**
Many crucial business decisions involve incomplete information and conflicting priorities. Experienced leaders develop judgment about which risks are worth taking and which tradeoffs make sense. This type of judgment emerges from years of seeing both successes and failures firsthand - something AI systems cannot truly replicate.

**Understanding Human Context**
Success in business ultimately depends on understanding human needs, motivations, and behaviors. While AI can process vast amounts of data about human behavior, it lacks the innate understanding that comes from being human and experiencing the full range of human emotions and social dynamics.

## Real-World Examples

Let's look at some specific examples of how this "what vs. how" divide plays out:

### Book-Writing: When Bulldozers Move Words

 What's the value of traditional books when ChatGPT can generate coherent answers to any question? 
 
 The analogy of construction work helps illustrate the relationship between AI and human authorship. Like bulldozers that efficiently move earth, AI can rapidly generate vast quantities of coherent text. But just as construction requires both heavy machinery and skilled artisans, meaningful books need both AI's raw productive power and human refinement.

Consider the process of learning chess. ChatGPT can explain rules, play practice games, and offer personalized instruction. Future versions might even customize the learning path based on individual aptitude and interests. However, a well-crafted book offers something different: a carefully structured approach that helps readers decide their level of engagement. The finite, constrained nature of a book provides focus that chatbots, with their endless potential for digression, cannot easily match.

The key to understanding AI's role in authorship lies in recognizing the distinct phases of book creation. 

1. The initial phase - deciding subject matter and scope, aka the "what" phase — remains fundamentally human. While AI can help brainstorm ideas or identify underexplored topics, the essential creative spark and purpose must come from human intention. This reflects a broader truth about AI: it excels at processing existing patterns but struggles to generate truly novel directions.

2. The next phase — outlining the subject into smaller, related topics that make a coherent whole — demonstrates the potential for human-AI collaboration. AI can quickly generate comprehensive topic structures, but human expertise is crucial for identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or areas requiring special emphasis. This interplay between AI's broad pattern recognition and human domain knowledge creates stronger frameworks than either could achieve alone.

3. The writing phase is where AI's "bulldozer" capabilities shine. Instead of laboriously crafting individual sentences, authors can use AI to generate substantial blocks of coherent text. This dramatically accelerates the initial draft process. However, like rough-graded earth, this AI-generated text requires careful refinement to achieve its final form.

4. The refinement phase is where human judgment becomes paramount. Authors must shape the AI-generated content to maintain consistent voice, ensure logical flow, and preserve the book's core purpose. This requires understanding nuances of audience expectations and subject matter that current AI systems cannot fully grasp.

This iterative process of generation and refinement continues until the project achieves its goals - another judgment that requires human evaluation. The result is neither purely AI-generated nor traditionally human-authored, but rather a new form of hybrid creativity that leverages the strengths of both.

The role of books may evolve, but their fundamental purpose - to present structured, focused exploration of subjects - will always be valuable. The challenge for authors is not to compete with AI's raw generative capabilities, but to use them effectively while maintaining the human elements that give books their lasting value.

This suggests a future where successful authors are those who master the art of AI collaboration rather than resist it. Just as modern architects must understand both traditional design principles and computer-aided tools, tomorrow's authors will need to balance classic writing skills with AI capabilities.

The key question is no longer whether AI will replace human authors, but how it will transform the authorship process. The answer lies in recognizing that while AI can move mountains of words, humans must still decide which mountains to move and how to shape the resulting landscape.

This transformation parallels broader changes in knowledge work. As AI handles more routine cognitive tasks, human value increasingly derives from higher-order skills like judgment, creativity, and strategic thinking. The future of authorship, like many professional fields, will belong to those who can effectively combine human insight with AI capabilities.

The rise of AI authors doesn't diminish the value of books but rather changes how they're created. The essential human elements - purpose, judgment, refinement - remain crucial, even as AI dramatically expands our capability to generate and process information. The result may be not just better books, but new forms of knowledge sharing that we're only beginning to imagine.

### Software Development: Beyond Code Generation

The construction industry provides useful analogies for understanding AI's impact on software development. Just as modern construction sites use both automated machinery and skilled human workers, software development is evolving into a hybrid process where AI handles routine coding tasks while humans focus on architecture and design decisions.

Consider a typical software project. Traditional development required writing every line of code manually, like building a house brick by brick. Now, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer can generate entire functions or modules automatically, similar to how prefabricated components accelerated construction. These AI tools excel at producing standard elements - authentication systems, database queries, API endpoints - just as manufacturing automation excels at producing standardized building materials.

However, like construction projects, software development involves more than assembling standard components. A successful project requires understanding user needs, designing intuitive interfaces, ensuring security, and maintaining long-term reliability. These higher-level decisions remain firmly in human territory.

The architectural parallel is particularly apt. Just as architects must consider aesthetics, functionality, and structural integrity, software architects must balance user experience, system performance, and code maintainability. AI can suggest implementation details, but it cannot determine whether a feature aligns with business goals or how it might affect user behavior.

Technical debt offers another illuminating comparison. In construction, taking shortcuts (like using lower-grade materials) can speed completion but creates future maintenance problems. Similarly, in software development, quick fixes and temporary solutions accumulate as technical debt. While AI can identify potential debt and suggest refactoring strategies, humans must weigh the business tradeoffs of addressing it now versus later.

Integration challenges further highlight AI's limitations. Modern software systems are complex ecosystems of interacting components, like cities with interconnected infrastructure systems. AI excels at optimizing individual components but struggles to understand system-wide implications. Humans must orchestrate these interactions, ensuring different parts work together coherently while maintaining system reliability and performance.

Security considerations demonstrate another crucial human role. Like building security systems, software security requires anticipating potential threats and implementing appropriate protections. AI can identify common vulnerabilities and suggest fixes, but it cannot understand the broader security context or evaluate risk tradeoffs. These decisions require human judgment informed by business context and threat assessment.

The testing and quality assurance phase reveals both AI's strengths and limitations. AI tools can automatically generate test cases and identify potential bugs, similar to automated building inspections. However, human testers are still essential for evaluating user experience, identifying edge cases, and ensuring the software meets business requirements. AI can verify that code works as written, but humans must verify it works as intended.

Looking ahead, successful software development will likely become increasingly collaborative between humans and AI. Development teams will need to master new workflows that leverage AI's capabilities while maintaining human oversight of critical decisions. This might involve using AI for initial code generation and routine maintenance while focusing human effort on architecture, security, and user experience.

This evolution parallels broader trends in professional work. Just as power tools didn't eliminate the need for skilled carpenters but changed how they work, AI won't eliminate software developers but will transform their role. The most valuable developers will be those who can effectively direct AI tools while maintaining high-level system understanding.

The implications for software education and training are significant. Future developers will need less emphasis on memorizing syntax and more focus on system design, architecture, and AI collaboration skills. This mirrors how modern architectural education focuses less on manual drafting and more on design principles and computer-aided tools.

However, the fundamental role of human creativity and judgment remains unchanged. Just as beautiful buildings require human vision despite advanced construction technology, great software requires human insight despite sophisticated AI tools. The key is understanding AI as an enabler of human creativity rather than its replacement.

This suggests that software development is entering a new phase where success depends on effectively combining AI capabilities with human insight. The future belongs not to those who can code fastest, but to those who can best envision how technology can serve human needs while using AI to implement that vision efficiently and reliably.

In this new paradigm, the measure of a developer shifts from lines of code written to the effectiveness of their human-AI collaboration in creating valuable software solutions. The construction industry's evolution from manual labor to machine-assisted craftsmanship provides a roadmap for this transformation.

### Investment Analysis: Beyond the Numbers

Just as modern factories use automation for routine manufacturing while relying on human expertise for product design and quality control, investment analysis is evolving into a hybrid process where AI handles data processing while humans focus on strategic insights and judgment calls.

Consider a typical investment analysis project. Traditionally, analysts spent countless hours gathering financial data, creating comparison spreadsheets, and writing preliminary reports. Now, AI can instantly process quarterly reports, generate peer comparisons, and draft initial analyses. This is similar to how automated assembly lines handle routine manufacturing tasks, freeing human workers to focus on complex problems requiring judgment and creativity.

However, like manufacturing, successful investing involves more than processing standard inputs. While AI excels at identifying patterns in financial statements and market data, it struggles with crucial qualitative factors. Can management be trusted? Is the company's competitive advantage sustainable? Will current market opportunities persist? These questions require human judgment informed by experience and industry knowledge.

The manufacturing quality control parallel is particularly relevant. Just as experienced inspectors can spot subtle defects that automated systems miss, seasoned investors can identify red flags in management behavior or market dynamics that AI might overlook. A CEO's body language during earnings calls, the timing of insider stock sales, or subtle shifts in competitive dynamics - these nuanced signals often prove more valuable than quantitative metrics.

Competitive analysis offers another illuminating comparison. In manufacturing, understanding market dynamics requires more than analyzing production statistics - it requires insight into changing consumer preferences, emerging technologies, and competitor strategies. Similarly, while AI can process vast amounts of market data, humans must evaluate whether a company's competitive position is truly defensible and whether management's strategy aligns with market realities.

The role of trust highlights another crucial human element. Just as manufacturing partnerships require trust built through personal relationships and demonstrated reliability, investment success often depends on accurately assessing management credibility. AI can flag inconsistencies in financial statements or unusual transaction patterns, but it cannot evaluate character or judge whether explanations for apparent irregularities are credible.

Market opportunity assessment demonstrates similar limitations. Like evaluating new manufacturing technologies, assessing market opportunities requires understanding both technical capabilities and human behavior. AI can analyze historical market data and identify trends, but it cannot predict how human customers, competitors, and regulators will react to new situations. These predictions require human insight into psychology and social dynamics.

Risk assessment reveals both AI's strengths and limitations. AI systems can quickly identify common risk factors and calculate standard metrics, similar to automated safety systems in manufacturing. However, the most significant risks often come from unexpected directions that don't appear in historical data. Human judgment remains essential for identifying and evaluating these non-obvious risks.

Looking ahead, successful investment analysis will likely become increasingly collaborative between humans and AI. Analysis teams will need to master new workflows that leverage AI's data processing capabilities while maintaining human oversight of critical judgments. This might involve using AI for initial screening and routine monitoring while focusing human effort on qualitative assessment and strategic thinking.

This evolution parallels broader trends in professional work. Just as automation didn't eliminate the need for skilled manufacturing workers but changed their role, AI won't eliminate investment analysts but will transform how they work. The most valuable analysts will be those who can effectively direct AI tools while maintaining deep industry understanding and judgment capabilities.

The implications for investment education and training are significant. Future analysts will need less emphasis on spreadsheet skills and more focus on business judgment and AI collaboration capabilities. This mirrors how modern manufacturing education focuses less on manual skills and more on process management and technology integration.

However, the fundamental role of human judgment remains unchanged. Just as quality manufacturing requires human oversight despite advanced automation, successful investing requires human insight despite sophisticated AI tools. The key is understanding AI as an enhancer of human judgment rather than its replacement.

This suggests that investment analysis is entering a new phase where success depends on effectively combining AI capabilities with human insight. The future belongs not to those who can process data fastest, but to those who can best understand business fundamentals while using AI to implement that understanding efficiently and reliably.

In this new paradigm, the measure of an analyst shifts from computational speed to the effectiveness of their human-AI collaboration in identifying truly attractive investments. The manufacturing industry's evolution from manual production to technology-enhanced craftsmanship provides a roadmap for this transformation.


### AI and Healthcare: Beyond Pattern Recognition

The evolution of AI in healthcare parallels modern manufacturing quality control, where automated systems handle routine inspections while skilled technicians focus on complex problems requiring human judgment. Similarly, healthcare is becoming a hybrid system where AI processes medical data while human doctors focus on patient relationships and complex medical decisions.

Consider a typical diagnostic process. Traditionally, doctors spent considerable time reviewing test results, consulting medical literature, and documenting findings. Now, AI can instantly analyze lab results, medical images, and patient histories to suggest potential diagnoses. This is similar to how automated inspection systems quickly identify defects in manufactured products, allowing human inspectors to focus on more complex quality issues.

However, like quality control, successful healthcare involves more than pattern recognition. While AI excels at identifying anomalies in test results and suggesting standard treatments, it struggles with crucial contextual factors. How will a patient's living situation affect treatment adherence? Which side effects are acceptable given a patient's lifestyle? What treatment modifications are needed given other health conditions? These questions require human judgment informed by direct patient interaction and medical experience.

The empathy factor is particularly relevant. Just as effective quality control requires understanding how products will be used in real-world conditions, effective healthcare requires understanding patients' lives and concerns. AI can process medical histories and suggest treatment protocols, but it cannot truly empathize with patient fears or understand how cultural and personal factors might affect treatment success.

Treatment customization offers another illuminating comparison. In manufacturing, standard quality metrics must often be adjusted for specific use cases. Similarly, while AI can recommend standard treatments based on medical literature, doctors must adapt these recommendations to individual patient circumstances. A treatment protocol that looks optimal on paper might be impractical or inappropriate given a patient's specific situation.

The trust relationship highlights another crucial human element. Just as manufacturing quality depends on trust between suppliers and customers, healthcare outcomes often depend on patient trust in their medical providers. AI can provide accurate medical information, but it cannot build the personal trust that encourages treatment compliance and honest symptom reporting.

Emergency response demonstrates both AI's strengths and limitations. AI systems can quickly process vital signs and suggest immediate interventions, similar to automated safety systems in manufacturing. However, emergency medicine often requires split-second decisions based on incomplete information and complex tradeoffs. Human judgment remains essential for these high-stakes decisions where standard protocols may not apply.

Looking ahead, successful healthcare will likely become increasingly collaborative between humans and AI. Medical teams will need to master new workflows that leverage AI's analytical capabilities while maintaining human oversight of critical decisions. This might involve using AI for initial screening and routine monitoring while focusing human effort on patient interaction and complex case management.

This evolution parallels broader trends in professional work. Just as automation didn't eliminate the need for skilled quality control technicians but changed their role, AI won't eliminate doctors but will transform how they work. The most valuable healthcare providers will be those who can effectively direct AI tools while maintaining strong patient relationships and clinical judgment.

The implications for medical education and training are significant. Future doctors will need less emphasis on memorizing medical facts and more focus on patient communication and AI collaboration skills. This mirrors how modern quality control training focuses less on inspection procedures and more on system management and problem-solving.

However, the fundamental role of human judgment remains unchanged. Just as quality control requires human oversight despite advanced inspection technology, healthcare requires human insight despite sophisticated AI tools. The key is understanding AI as an enhancer of medical judgment rather than its replacement.

This suggests that healthcare is entering a new phase where success depends on effectively combining AI capabilities with human insight. The future belongs not to those who can recall the most medical facts, but to those who can best understand patient needs while using AI to implement that understanding efficiently and safely.

In this new paradigm, the measure of a healthcare provider shifts from diagnostic speed to the effectiveness of their human-AI collaboration in achieving optimal patient outcomes. The quality control industry's evolution from manual inspection to technology-enhanced oversight provides a roadmap for this transformation.

The challenge ahead is not whether to adopt AI in healthcare, but how to integrate it while preserving the human elements that make medicine effective. Success will require understanding both AI's capabilities and its limitations, while never losing sight of healthcare's fundamental mission: helping human patients achieve better health outcomes through personalized, compassionate care.

## Investment Implications

This shift has important implications for investors:

**Winners**:
- Companies that help humans make better "what" decisions
- Tools that augment human judgment rather than replace it
- Platforms that combine AI capabilities with human insight
- Businesses with strong human judgment at their core

**Losers**:
- Pure automation plays that don't preserve human judgment
- Companies selling commoditized "how" skills
- Businesses that can't articulate their human advantage

## The Future of Work

This transition suggests several changes in how organizations will operate:

**New Organizational Structures**

- Flatter hierarchies as AI handles routine coordination
- Smaller, more senior teams focused on "what" decisions
- Greater emphasis on judgment and strategic thinking

**Changed Skill Requirements**

- Less focus on technical tool proficiency
- More emphasis on strategic thinking and judgment
- Greater value placed on cross-domain knowledge

**Modified Training Approaches**

- Reduced time spent teaching technical "how" skills
- Increased focus on judgment development
- More emphasis on understanding human factors

## Preparing for the Transition

For individuals and organizations looking to succeed in this new environment, several approaches make sense:

**For Individuals**:

- Focus on developing judgment through varied experiences
- Build broad knowledge across multiple domains
- Practice making and learning from strategic decisions
- Get comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty

**For Organizations**:

- Invest in tools that augment human judgment
- Develop processes that capture and share strategic insights
- Create cultures that value and develop good judgment
- Build teams with diverse perspectives and experiences

### The Human Element Remains Central

It's crucial to remember that this shift doesn't diminish the importance of human contribution - it actually elevates it. As AI handles more routine tasks, human judgment, creativity, and wisdom become more valuable, not less.

Consider the example of chess: Despite AI systems being able to beat any human player, human chess hasn't disappeared. Instead, it's evolved. The most interesting matches now involve human-AI collaboration, where success depends on humans knowing what positions to play for and when to trust or override AI suggestions.

This pattern will likely repeat across many fields - the key to success will be understanding what humans do best and creating systems that augment these capabilities rather than try to replace them.

## Looking Ahead

The transition from "how" to "what" won't happen overnight, but it's already underway. Organizations and individuals that recognize and adapt to this shift will have significant advantages. Those that continue to focus primarily on "how" skills risk finding their capabilities increasingly commoditized by AI.

This shift also suggests we need to rethink education and training. Rather than focusing primarily on teaching technical skills that AI might soon handle, we should emphasize developing judgment, creativity, and strategic thinking - the fundamentally human capabilities that will become increasingly valuable.

The future belongs not to those who can execute tasks most efficiently, but to those who can best decide what tasks are worth doing in the first place.
