subtitle: "Implications of the coming shift in human value"

Until recently, career success in knowledge work depended heavily on mastering "how" skills - knowing how to build a compelling PowerPoint, how to structure a financial model, or how to write efficient code. But as AI systems become more capable at these technical tasks, the competitive advantage is shifting dramatically toward people who know "what" needs to be done - those who can identify the right problems to solve and strategies to pursue.

This fundamental shift from "how" to "what" has profound implications for businesses, careers, and investment opportunities. Let's explore why this transformation is happening and what it means for different stakeholders.

### The Traditional "How" Advantage

Traditionally, organizations needed large teams of specialists who knew "how" to perform various technical tasks:
- Financial analysts who knew how to build complex Excel models
- Software engineers who knew how to write code in specific languages
- Designers who knew how to use tools like Photoshop
- Writers who knew how to craft clear technical documentation
- Translators who knew how to convert text between languages

These specialists developed their skills through years of practice and training. Their expertise created both job security and earning power - companies were willing to pay premium salaries for people who could execute complex technical tasks effectively.

### AI's Disruption of "How"

Large language models and other AI tools are rapidly getting better at many of these "how" tasks:
- ChatGPT can write basic code in multiple languages
- Midjourney can generate sophisticated images
- Translation tools are approaching human-level quality
- AI assistants can create presentations and documentation

This capability is expanding quickly. Tasks that seemed immune to automation just a few years ago are now being handled competently by AI systems. And unlike human specialists who may take years to master new skills, AI systems can be rapidly retrained or fine-tuned for new capabilities.

### The Rise of "What" Skills

As AI handles more of the "how," competitive advantage shifts to people who excel at determining "what" needs to be done:
- What problems are worth solving?
- What features should a product include?
- What markets should a company enter?
- What strategies will create sustainable advantages?
- What metrics matter most for success?

These "what" decisions require capabilities that current AI systems fundamentally lack:

**Pattern Recognition Across Domains**
Humans can notice subtle patterns and draw insights across seemingly unrelated fields. A business leader might see parallels between consumer behavior in fashion and trends in enterprise software, leading to novel strategic insights. Current AI systems, despite their broad training, struggle to make these creative connections in meaningful ways.

**Judgment Under Uncertainty**
Many crucial business decisions involve incomplete information and conflicting priorities. Experienced leaders develop judgment about which risks are worth taking and which tradeoffs make sense. This type of judgment emerges from years of seeing both successes and failures firsthand - something AI systems cannot truly replicate.

**Understanding Human Context**
Success in business ultimately depends on understanding human needs, motivations, and behaviors. While AI can process vast amounts of data about human behavior, it lacks the innate understanding that comes from being human and experiencing the full range of human emotions and social dynamics.

### Real-World Examples

Let's look at some specific examples of how this "what vs. how" divide plays out:

**Software Development**
- How: AI can now write basic code, debug problems, and even suggest optimizations
- What: Humans still needed to determine which features will delight users, how different components should work together, and what technical debt is worth taking on

**Investment Analysis**
- How: AI can process financial statements, generate comparison tables, and even write initial analysis
- What: Humans required to identify which companies have sustainable advantages, which management teams are trustworthy, and which market opportunities are truly attractive

**Healthcare**
- How: AI increasingly capable at analyzing test results, suggesting diagnoses, and recommending treatments
- What: Human doctors crucial for understanding patient context, weighing complex tradeoffs, and maintaining trust in treatment decisions

### Investment Implications

This shift has important implications for investors:

**Winners**:
- Companies that help humans make better "what" decisions
- Tools that augment human judgment rather than replace it
- Platforms that combine AI capabilities with human insight
- Businesses with strong human judgment at their core

**Losers**:
- Pure automation plays that don't preserve human judgment
- Companies selling commoditized "how" skills
- Businesses that can't articulate their human advantage

### The Future of Work

This transition suggests several changes in how organizations will operate:

**New Organizational Structures**
- Flatter hierarchies as AI handles routine coordination
- Smaller, more senior teams focused on "what" decisions
- Greater emphasis on judgment and strategic thinking

**Changed Skill Requirements**
- Less focus on technical tool proficiency
- More emphasis on strategic thinking and judgment
- Greater value placed on cross-domain knowledge

**Modified Training Approaches**
- Reduced time spent teaching technical "how" skills
- Increased focus on judgment development
- More emphasis on understanding human factors

### Preparing for the Transition

For individuals and organizations looking to succeed in this new environment, several approaches make sense:

**For Individuals**:
- Focus on developing judgment through varied experiences
- Build broad knowledge across multiple domains
- Practice making and learning from strategic decisions
- Get comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty

**For Organizations**:
- Invest in tools that augment human judgment
- Develop processes that capture and share strategic insights
- Create cultures that value and develop good judgment
- Build teams with diverse perspectives and experiences

### The Human Element Remains Central

It's crucial to remember that this shift doesn't diminish the importance of human contribution - it actually elevates it. As AI handles more routine tasks, human judgment, creativity, and wisdom become more valuable, not less.

Consider the example of chess: Despite AI systems being able to beat any human player, human chess hasn't disappeared. Instead, it's evolved. The most interesting matches now involve human-AI collaboration, where success depends on humans knowing what positions to play for and when to trust or override AI suggestions.

This pattern will likely repeat across many fields - the key to success will be understanding what humans do best and creating systems that augment these capabilities rather than try to replace them.

### Looking Ahead

The transition from "how" to "what" won't happen overnight, but it's already underway. Organizations and individuals that recognize and adapt to this shift will have significant advantages. Those that continue to focus primarily on "how" skills risk finding their capabilities increasingly commoditized by AI.

This shift also suggests we need to rethink education and training. Rather than focusing primarily on teaching technical skills that AI might soon handle, we should emphasize developing judgment, creativity, and strategic thinking - the fundamentally human capabilities that will become increasingly valuable.

The future belongs not to those who can execute tasks most efficiently, but to those who can best decide what tasks are worth doing in the first place.
