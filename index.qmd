# Preface {.unnumbered}


In early 2025, Bill Gates was a guest on NBC’s _The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon_. Speaking of AI, Gates said to Fallon:

> The era that we are just starting is that intelligence is rare, you know, a great doctor, a great teacher. And with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace: great medical advice, great tutoring. And it’s kind of profound because it solves all these specific problems, like we don’t have enough doctors or mental health professionals. But it brings with it so much change, what will jobs be like, should we just work two or three days a week? So I love the way it will drive innovation forward, but I think it’s a little bit unknown. Will we be able to shape it? And so, legitimately, people are wow, this is a bit scary, it’s completely new territory.

Asked then by Fallon whether we will “_still need humans_”, Gates answered “_not for most things_” and then “_there will be some things that we reserve for ourselves, but in terms of making things, and moving things and growing food, over time, those will be basically solved problems._”

In these few sentences, Gates touched on the main themes of this book: the role of AI in performing basic tasks, the uncertainty concerning many occupations, the scariness of new territory, and the fact that some things will remain reserved for human beings.

In this book, we present a thesis that the human being will remain at the center of the AI revolution. Some jobs will disappear but other new ones will be created. We also differentiate between the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ involved in every project. AI models will excel at the ‘how’, but human beings will remain unmatched in the ‘what’.

The archetype project of the future, as we envision it, will be largely carried out by robots or AI models but it will still be directed, masterminded, choreographed and led by humans who will remain the indispensable actors in the effort.

We propose this book as an example of such a project. First the two of us worked together for eight months, writing a weekly AI-themed column on Substack. Second, we created an outline for this book. Third, we fed Claude all of the columns that we had written and asked it to start generating the chapters of the book according to the outline. Fourth, we fact-checked the text and prompted Claude to make changes in order to refine the chapters. Finally, we edited the text in the traditional way to improve it and to remove redundancies or inconsistencies.
This process exemplifies our notion of how AI will be used in the future, not to replace human beings, but to enhance their work.

Each of us brought decades of experience that were complementary to each other, Richard from the tech world and Sami from the financial world. This wide combined expertise allowed us to approach the question of AI in the future world not only from a technical perspective but also with the mind of an investor. 

So is this an AI-written book? Yes and no, but mostly no. Yes, in the sense that several sections of the text were AI-generated. No, and this is in our view the critical qualifier, because AI generated those sections after training itself on text that we had previously written in the traditional (non AI-assisted) way. No also because we corrected, fact-checked and edited all AI-generated text. We used AI as a powerful assistant, but the end result is a product of two humans.

As we write in chapter 3, “_the key question is no longer whether AI will replace human authors, but how it will transform the authorship process. The answer lies in recognizing that while AI can move mountains of words, humans must still decide which mountains to move and how to shape the resulting landscape._”

At the same time, it was important to us to do an editing job that was not too extensive because that would defeat the thesis that AI can do a large share of the work. Many sections were left intact as produced by Claude.

To the extent that some errors have survived the final cut, they should be attributed to AI and not to any motive on our part to mislead or misinform.

Finally, AI can sometimes be repetitive. We have reduced repetition as much as possible, while being mindful not to re-write entire sections. The end product is intended to showcase our central thesis, which is that AI is a powerful assistant, but the human will retain the lead in every project.
