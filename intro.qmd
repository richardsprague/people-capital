# Introduction {.unnumbered}

In 2021, a team of music historians, musicologists, composers and computer scientists gathered in... to undertake a task that had never been attempted before: to complete Beethoven's tenth symphony with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Beethoven had started composing the symphony but had died in 1827 before making much progress. He only left behind a few musical sketches, not a substantive draft on which the team could easily build. Nonetheless, the team trained a computer on Beethoven's entire body of work and then let AI do the rest of the work, the composing of the entire symphony.

This is the typical way that AI works, in two main steps: firt "to learn" and then "to do". An AI program has to first learn or "train" from an existing database everything that it can learn that is relevant to the planned project. This is the training phase. Then the AI program has to do or respond to a request to use what it has learned during the training phase to deliver a response or an output. This is the inference phase.

This is exactly what the ... team did. They trained AI on Beethoven's symphonies and other musical pieces, as well as the early sketches he had started for the tenth symphony, and then asked the AI program to create the rest of the symphony based on what it had learned during the training phase.

We start with this project because it neatly summarizes common aspirations about AI. Many people do expect AI to eventually replace the vast majority of human work. And here was an example with a team of professionals training a machine to replace, or at least replicate, the work of a human, albeit a genius and not an ordinary human.

There were much pomp and expectation around the project and the team announced that the tenth symphony created by AI would be released in a world premiere performance in Bonn, Germany, on October 9, 2021. When the day came, ...

In the subsequent days and months, a consensus gradually formed about the AI generated tenth symphony. And it was this: the music did sound like Beethoven in many parts, but it lacked the ultimate ingredients that made other symphonies masterpieces: passion, spirit, a tangible human touch. Instead the AI tenth sounded mechanical and betrayed its genesis by being too repetitive in the wrong places. In short, it was precise and competent in the way of a robot, but it was ultimate deficient for its inability to convey passion, to elevate and to inspire listeners.

In our readings about the AI generated symphony, we looked at a large number of opinions by experts from all walks of life. But one in particular from Jan... summarizes, in our view, the central reason that the AI-generated tenth symphony fell short of actual Beethoven-created symphonies. It was not only that it was mechanical and repetitive. Perhaps these flaws could have been fixed in a subsequent iteration. Nor was it that... In the end, as J... put it, the tenth symphony fails to stir us for one main reason which is that listeners "want to see the human do it."

Humans want to see other humans do it. These eight words sum up the thesis of this book. And from them, we derive our belief that AI can be a very effective assistant to humans in a large number of tasks but it will never satisfactorily replace humans. Leadership and teamwork require the input and inspiration imparted by a leader and by team mates, and a robot, or AI-trained program, will never be able to provide that human input and this inspiration.

This is the right time to have this conversation because the AI revolution has spawned two competing narratives, both fundamentally wrong. The doomsayers warn of widespread job displacement as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly capable of performing human tasks. The techno-utopians promise a future where AI solves humanity's greatest challenges, freeing us from mundane work. But the reality emerging from actual AI implementations tells a different story – one where artificial intelligence enhances rather than replaces human capabilities. This means that the doomsayers are wrong because the optimal completion of a task will remain elusive without the work of humans using AI. And it also means that the techno-utopians are also wrong because AI will not harness the creativity that is need to solve on its own our greatest challenges.

Our own view is that AI is best seen as a force multiplier, and a formidable one. Humanity has developed many force multipliers through its history and they have all added to the productivity of humans and to the wealth of society. And now humanity will develop yet another, and perhaps the most powerful of all, force multiplier that will similarly boost productivity and raise living standards.

This is not to say that all jobs will be preserved. Of course, there will be much disruption and dislocation. Many jobs will completely disappear or will be completely taken over by AI, but AI will be in most cases a very competent and very efficient assistant, not a leader or conductor of the proceedings. It is true at the same time that large numbers of people will need to retrain to do other jobs, but this has often be true in our modern society. It may well be that the numbers will be larger this time around, but they were also larger last time than they had been the previous time. Human progress is inherently destructive of jobs that can be replaced by machine. There are millions of robots today that perform the tasks that used to be done by human factory workers only a few decades ago. This has always been the march of technology. AI may be faster than previous revolutions, but then its rewards will also be faster and richer.

Talking more practically, we have already observed a pattern across industries that supports our thesis: the most successful AI applications are those that augment human judgment rather than attempt to replicate it. Here we draw on our long experiences in finance and technology. We see that from financial trading desks to hospital diagnostic centers, from military command posts to creative studios, the winning formula consistently involves keeping humans "in the loop" while leveraging AI's computational capabilities. We are in the early days of AI but our view is that this will remain true with future AI systems that are far more developed than today's.

Previous technological revolutions followed similar paths. There was much concern among bank tellers when ATMs were first introduced that the job of a human teller was going to disappear. This was a rational fear. Why wait in line to see a teller if you can just make deposits and withdrawals at an ATM? And from the bank's point of view, why employ tellers when you can deploy ATMs at a much lower cost? It turned however that people still needed human tellers for transactions that went beyond simple deposits and withdrawals. But another dynamic proved even more revealing. Because banks were able to reduce the number of tellers per branch and were also able to reduce their costs thanks to other technological advances, they were ultimately able to open more branches, each of which required a minimal number of human tellers. The net result is that the total number of people employed as tellers was in fact larger after ATMs were introduced than before they were introduced.

The same experience was repeated in other fields. Computer-aided design tools were expected to replace architects; instead, they enhanced architects' ability to explore creative possibilities through new technology and it allowed architecture firms to hire more architects.

One key difference today may be the pace and scope of change that AI enables.

What makes AI unique is its ability to process vast amounts of data and recognize patterns that humans might miss. But this capability, impressive as it is, remains fundamentally different from human intelligence. AI can analyze millions of medical images to flag potential anomalies, but it takes a doctor's judgment to interpret these findings in the context of a patient's overall health. AI can process thousands of financial data points per second, but it takes a human analyst to understand how changing geopolitical dynamics might affect market sentiment.

This book challenges both the fear-mongering and the hype around AI. Instead, we present a framework for understanding how AI can enhance human capabilities across industries. Drawing on real-world case studies and our own experience implementing AI solutions, we demonstrate why keeping humans central to decision-making leads to better outcomes than pursuing full automation.
For business leaders, this book offers practical guidance on implementing AI in ways that augment rather than replace human workers. For investors, we provide frameworks for evaluating AI companies based on their approach to human-AI collaboration. For policymakers, we outline principles for governing AI development while preserving human agency and judgment.

The coming decades will see artificial intelligence transform every industry. But this transformation will not follow the simple pattern of automation and replacement that many predict. Instead, we are entering an era of enhancement, where human capabilities are amplified by AI rather than superseded by it. Understanding this distinction – and its implications for business strategy, investment decisions, and policy choices – will be crucial for navigating the AI revolution.

The future belongs not to those who try to replicate human intelligence, but to those who find ways to enhance it. This is the human element in the AI revolution.
