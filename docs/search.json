    "text": "Preface\nIn early 2025, Bill Gates was a guest on NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Speaking of AI, Gates said to Fallon:\n\nThe era that we are just starting is that intelligence is rare, you know, a great doctor, a great teacher. And with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace: great medical advice, great tutoring. And it’s kind of profound because it solves all these specific problems, like we don’t have enough doctors or mental health professionals. But it brings with it so much change, what will jobs be like, should we just work two or three days a week? So I love the way it will drive innovation forward, but I think it’s a little bit unknown. Will we be able to shape it? And so, legitimately, people are wow, this is a bit scary, it’s completely new territory.\n\nAsked then by Fallon whether we will “still need humans”, Gates answered “not for most things” and then “there will be some things that we reserve for ourselves, but in terms of making things, and moving things and growing food, over time, those will be basically solved problems.”\nIn these few sentences, Gates touched on the main themes of this book: the role of AI in performing basic tasks, the uncertainty concerning many occupations, the scariness of new territory, and the fact that some things will remain reserved for human beings.\nIn this book, we present a thesis that the human being will remain at the center of the AI revolution. Some jobs will disappear but other new ones will be created. We also differentiate between the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ involved in every project. AI models will excel at the ‘how’, but human beings will remain unmatched in the ‘what’.\nThe archetype project of the future, as we envision it, will be largely carried out by robots or AI models but it will still be directed, masterminded, choreographed and led by humans who will remain the indispensable actors in the effort.\nWe propose this book as an example of such a project. First the two of us worked together for eight months, writing a weekly AI-themed column on Substack. Second, we created an outline for this book. Third, we fed Claude all of the columns that we had written and asked it to start generating the chapters of the book according to the outline. Fourth, we fact-checked the text and prompted Claude to make changes in order to refine the chapters. Finally, we edited the text in the traditional way to improve it and to remove redundancies or inconsistencies. This process exemplifies our notion of how AI will be used in the future, not to replace human beings, but to enhance their work.\nEach of us brought decades of experience that were complementary to each other, Richard from the tech world and Sami from the financial world. This wide combined expertise allowed us to approach the question of AI in the future world not only from a technical perspective but also with the mind of an investor.\nSo is this an AI-written book? Yes and no, but mostly no. Yes, in the sense that several sections of the text were AI-generated. No, and this is in our view the critical qualifier, because AI generated those sections after training itself on text that we had previously written in the traditional (non AI-assisted) way. No also because we corrected, fact-checked and edited all AI-generated text. We used AI as a powerful assistant, but the end result is a product of two humans.\nAs we write in chapter 3, “the key question is no longer whether AI will replace human authors, but how it will transform the authorship process. The answer lies in recognizing that while AI can move mountains of words, humans must still decide which mountains to move and how to shape the resulting landscape.”\nAt the same time, it was important to us to do an editing job that was not too extensive because that would defeat the thesis that AI can do a large share of the work. Many sections were left intact as produced by Claude.\nTo the extent that some errors have survived the final cut, they should be attributed to AI and not to any motive on our part to mislead or misinform.\nFinally, AI can sometimes be repetitive. We have reduced repetition as much as possible, while being mindful not to re-write entire sections. The end product is intended to showcase our central thesis, which is that AI is a powerful assistant, but the human will retain the lead in every project.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "In 2021, a fascinating experiment took place in the world of classical music. A team of music historians, musicologists, composers, and computer scientists gathered to undertake an unprecedented task: completing Beethoven’s unfinished Tenth Symphony with the help of artificial intelligence. Beethoven had begun composing this symphony but died in 1827 before making significant progress, leaving behind only a few musical sketches rather than a substantive draft.\nThe team approached this challenge using the two-step process typical of AI applications. First came the training phase, where they fed Beethoven’s entire body of work—his completed symphonies, chamber music, and piano compositions—into their AI system, along with the sketches he had started for the Tenth Symphony. Then came the inference phase, where they asked the AI to generate the rest of the symphony based on what it had learned.\nThis project neatly encapsulates a common aspiration: the idea that AI might eventually replace human creative work. Here was a team of professionals training a machine to replicate the work of a human genius. The stakes were high, with considerable publicity surrounding the announcement that the AI-generated Tenth Symphony would premiere in Bonn, Germany—Beethoven’s birthplace—on October 9, 2021.\nWhen the performance finally took place, the initial response was impressive. The music did sound Beethoven-esque in many parts. Yet in the days and months that followed, a consensus emerged: while technically competent, the AI-generated symphony lacked the essential qualities that made Beethoven’s actual works masterpieces. It missed the passion, spirit, and tangible human touch that defines great art. Instead, it sounded somewhat mechanical and betrayed its artificial genesis through repetitive patterns. It was precise and competent, but ultimately deficient in its ability to convey emotion, to elevate, and to inspire listeners.\nAmong the many expert opinions we reviewed, one comment from music critic and Beethoven scholar Jan Swafford particularly resonated. He described the AI composition as “aimless and uninspired” and observed that what audiences fundamentally want is “to see the human doing it.” This insight—that humans want to see other humans create—forms the central thesis of our book.\nWe believe AI can serve as an extraordinarily effective assistant to humans across numerous domains, but it will never satisfactorily replace the human element. Leadership, teamwork, and creative work require the inspiration and judgment that only humans can provide. An AI program, no matter how sophisticated, cannot replicate these quintessentially human qualities.\nThis is a particularly appropriate moment to explore this perspective, as the AI revolution has generated two competing narratives, both fundamentally flawed. The doomsayers warn of widespread job displacement as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly capable of performing human tasks. The techno-utopians promise a future where AI solves humanity’s greatest challenges, freeing us from mundane work. But the reality emerging from actual AI implementations tells a different story—one where artificial intelligence enhances rather than replaces human capabilities.\nIn our view, AI functions best as a force multiplier. Throughout history, humanity has developed many such force multipliers—from the wheel to the printing press to the computer—all of which have enhanced human productivity and contributed to societal wealth. AI represents perhaps the most powerful force multiplier yet developed, with the potential to dramatically boost productivity and raise living standards.\nThis is not to say the transition will be painless. Many jobs will disappear or transform dramatically, and significant numbers of people will need to retrain for new roles. But this pattern of creative destruction has been a constant feature of technological progress. The industrial revolution replaced manual labor with machines; the digital revolution automated clerical tasks; now the AI revolution will reshape knowledge work. Each wave of change brings disruption but ultimately creates new opportunities and greater prosperity.\nDrawing on our combined experience in finance and technology, we’ve observed a consistent pattern across industries: the most successful AI applications are those that augment human judgment rather than attempt to replace it. From financial trading desks to hospital diagnostic centers, from military command posts to creative studios, the winning formula consistently involves keeping humans “in the loop” while leveraging AI’s computational capabilities.\nPrevious technological revolutions follow similar trajectories. Recall the introduction of ATMs in banking. Many predicted the extinction of human bank tellers. Yet something unexpected happened: while fewer tellers were needed per branch, banks opened more branches, and the total number of tellers actually increased. The nature of their work evolved from routine transactions to more complex customer service and relationship management.\nThe same pattern emerged with computer-aided design tools in architecture. Rather than replacing architects, these tools enhanced their creative capabilities and ultimately enabled firms to hire more architects to pursue more ambitious projects.\nWhat makes AI unique is its ability to process vast amounts of data and recognize patterns that humans might miss. But this capability, impressive as it is, remains fundamentally different from human intelligence. AI can analyze millions of medical images to flag potential anomalies, but it takes a doctor’s judgment to interpret these findings in the context of a patient’s overall health. AI can process thousands of financial data points per second, but it takes a human analyst to understand how changing geopolitical dynamics might affect market sentiment.\nThroughout this book, we challenge both the fear-mongering and the hype surrounding AI, presenting instead a framework for understanding how AI can enhance human capabilities across industries. Drawing on real-world case studies and our own experience implementing AI solutions, we demonstrate why keeping humans central to decision-making leads to better outcomes than pursuing full automation.\nFor business leaders, we offer practical guidance on implementing AI in ways that augment rather than replace human workers. For investors, we provide frameworks for evaluating AI companies based on their approach to human-AI collaboration. For policymakers, we outline principles for governing AI development while preserving human agency and judgment.\nThe coming decades will see artificial intelligence transform every industry. But this transformation will not follow the simple pattern of automation and replacement that many predict. Instead, we are entering an era of enhancement, where human capabilities are amplified by AI rather than superseded by it. Understanding this distinction—and its implications for business strategy, investment decisions, and policy choices—will be crucial for navigating the AI revolution.\nThe future belongs not to those who try to replicate human intelligence, but to those who find ways to enhance it. This is the human element in the AI revolution.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 Beyond Replacement: The Historical Lens\nWhen ATMs rolled out across bank lobbies in the 1970s, the forecast was grim for tellers. Machines that could spit out cash and swallow deposits seemed poised to erase a whole category of jobs. Why pay humans to handle transactions when steel boxes could do it faster and cheaper? Yet, the numbers told a different story. By the 1990s, the U.S. had more bank tellers than before ATMs arrived—not fewer. The machines slashed the cost of running a branch, so banks opened more of them. Tellers didn’t vanish; their work morphed into something less mechanical—advising customers, solving problems, building trust. Technology didn’t replace them. It redefined them.\nThis story isn’t an outlier. It’s a blueprint. From looms to assembly lines, every leap in automation has sparked the same debate: will machines liberate us or leave us jobless? Today, artificial intelligence has reignited that question with a vengeance. Techno-optimists paint a future where AI cures diseases and halts climate disasters, while doomsayers see a world of shuttered offices and idle hands. Both sides, though, are stuck in a false binary—replacement or utopia—that misses what’s really unfolding. AI isn’t here to take over human work. It’s here to amplify it. The evidence, from history to the latest deployments, shows that the most powerful outcomes come when humans and machines collaborate, not when one tries to oust the other.\nThis chapter sets the stage for that argument. We’ll unpack why the replacement narrative keeps falling short, explore where AI shines and where it stumbles, and show how this shift toward enhancement is already reshaping industries. The goal isn’t to dismiss AI’s potential or its disruptions—it’s to reframe the conversation around what it can realistically do alongside us.\nThe ATM tale is a good starting point because it’s concrete. Between 1970 and 2010, teller jobs grew from about 500,000 to 600,000 in the U.S., even as ATMs ballooned from a handful to over 400,000. Banks didn’t ditch humans; they leaned on machines to handle the rote stuff—counting bills, processing checks—freeing tellers to tackle thornier tasks like mortgage advice or fraud disputes. The tech didn’t erase the human touch; it made it more valuable by stripping away the mundane.\nThis pattern echoes across decades. When computer-aided design (CAD) software hit architecture firms in the 1980s, skeptics predicted drafting tables would gather dust and architects would fade into obsolescence. Instead, CAD turbocharged creativity. Architects could test wilder ideas, tweak designs in real time, and pitch clients with vivid 3D models. Firms didn’t shrink—they expanded, hiring more talent to dream bigger. The software didn’t supplant human vision; it gave it wings.\nFast-forward to the 21st century, and the script holds. Amazon’s warehouses buzz with robots zipping packages along conveyor belts, yet human workers haven’t vanished. In 2023, the company employed over 1.5 million people—up from 800,000 in 2019—despite pouring billions into automation. Robots excel at fetching boxes, but humans handle the exceptions: a torn label, an odd-shaped item, a last-minute order tweak. The machines crank through the predictable; people wrestle with the messy. Together, they’ve turned Amazon into a logistics juggernaut—not by replacing workers, but by retooling their roles.\nThese examples cut through the hype. Technology doesn’t follow a straight line from human to machine. It zigzags, finding new ways to mesh with what we’re good at. AI, for all its dazzle, fits this mold—not breaks it.",

    "text": "1.2 The Hype and the Hope: AI’s Modern Moment\nEnter ChatGPT in late 2022. Overnight, AI went from a buzzword to a living room guest. It could write poems, debug code, even fake a job interview. CEOs scribbled AI-first strategies, stocks like NVIDIA spiked, and headlines swung between marvel and panic. Some saw a golden age dawning—AI as the ultimate problem-solver. Others braced for collapse—white-collar jobs vaporized by algorithms. The truth, as usual, is less dramatic but more interesting.\nTake Microsoft’s CoPilot, an AI baked into Office tools. A Fortune 500 consumer goods company rolled it out in 2023, hoping to slash grunt work. It churned out email drafts, meeting summaries, and slide decks at lightning speed. But the shine faded fast. Employees spent hours tweaking outputs—fixing tone, adding context, catching errors the AI couldn’t see. A manager drafting a client pitch found CoPilot’s version polished but flat, missing the rapport that seals deals. The tool saved time on mechanics, sure, but the human layer—judgment, intent, finesse—still ruled the outcome.\nThis isn’t a knock on CoPilot. It’s a clue. AI’s strength lies in crunching what’s known—data, patterns, templates. It’s a wizard at “how” once you’ve nailed the “what.” But deciding what matters—strategy, purpose, nuance—that’s where humans hold court. In software development, GitHub Copilot spits out code snippets with eerie precision, but it’s useless without a programmer framing the problem: What’s the user need? How should this system scale? The AI executes; humans steer.\nEven in creative turf, the story tracks. Recall the 2021 bid to finish Beethoven’s 10th symphony with AI. A team fed it every note Beethoven ever wrote, plus his early sketches, and let it compose. The result debuted in Bonn to fanfare—and fell flat. Critics like Jan Swafford pegged it right: it mimicked Beethoven’s style but lacked his fire. The notes aligned, but the soul didn’t stir. Listeners craved the human behind the music—not just the sound, but the struggle and spark that made it real. AI could assemble; it couldn’t inspire.",

    "text": "1.3 Where AI Shines, Where It Stalls\nTo get why this keeps happening, we need to peek under AI’s hood—just enough to see its edges. Today’s systems, like the large language models powering ChatGPT, are pattern machines. They’re trained on mountains of text, images, or whatever you feed them, then predict what comes next based on stats and probabilities. Chess-playing AI doesn’t “think” like a grandmaster—it calculates moves at a scale humans can’t touch. Medical imaging AI doesn’t “diagnose”—it flags oddities in X-rays faster than a radiologist’s eye.\nThis is potent stuff. In 2023, a Stanford study found AI could spot pneumonia in chest scans with 92% accuracy, edging out human averages. Financial firms now use algorithms to sift through earnings calls and news feeds, catching signals in seconds that once took analysts days. But here’s the catch: these wins are narrow. The imaging AI can’t ask a patient about symptoms or weigh their stress levels. The trading bot can’t sense a CEO’s bluff or predict a geopolitical curveball. They’re tools—sharp, fast, tireless—but not minds.\nHumans bring what AI can’t: context, curiosity, agency. A doctor doesn’t just read scans; she reads people—piecing together lifestyle, history, and gut hunches. A trader doesn’t just crunch numbers; he reads the room—gauging fear, greed, or a rival’s next move. AI lacks that “being-in-the-world” quality Martin Heidegger flagged in philosophy—our knack for living through experience, not just processing it. It’s why a warehouse worker spots a glitch robots miss, or why an architect’s wild sketch beats CAD’s perfect lines.\nThis gap isn’t a flaw to fix—it’s a feature to harness. AI’s best trick isn’t autonomy; it’s augmentation. Starbucks didn’t axe baristas for robot brewers. In 2022, it rolled out AI to fine-tune inventory and staffing, cutting waste and wait times. Baristas got breathing room to chat with regulars, upsell pastries, build loyalty—the human stuff that drives profit. Sales climbed, not because machines took over, but because they cleared space for people to shine.",

    "text": "1.4 The Enhancement Edge: Real-World Proof\nLet’s widen the lens. In healthcare, AI’s diagnostic chops are transforming clinics—but not by sidelining doctors. At Mount Sinai in New York, AI systems now screen mammograms, catching tumors radiologists might overlook. Yet the final call stays human. Why? Because patients don’t just need a scan—they need a conversation, a plan, someone to trust. A 2023 trial showed AI-assisted doctors caught 20% more cancers than AI or humans alone. The combo wins, not the machine solo.\nIn logistics, UPS leaned on AI to optimize delivery routes, slashing fuel costs by millions in 2022. Drivers didn’t vanish—they adapted, handling quirks like gated estates or rush-hour snarls the algorithm couldn’t predict. The tech shaved miles; humans kept it real. Creative fields follow suit. Pixar’s artists use AI to render scenes at breakneck speed, but the storyboards—the heart of every film—stay hand-drawn by humans chasing a vision machines can’t dream up.\nEven language translation, where AI’s made huge strides, leans on this dance. Google Translate can churn through 100 languages, but for legal contracts or poetry, human linguists step in. A 2023 study pitted AI against pros on French-to-English novels; the AI nailed grammar but flubbed idioms and tone. Humans caught the culture—AI just caught the words.",

    "text": "1.5 Reframing the Future\nSo why do we keep buying the replacement myth? Partly, it’s the dazzle—AI’s feats feel like magic, so we assume it’s boundless. Partly, it’s fear—disruption’s real, and jobs will shift. But history whispers a steadier truth: tech amplifies us when we wield it right. The ATM didn’t kill tellers; it multiplied branches. CAD didn’t end architects; it fueled bolder buildings. AI won’t erase work—it’ll reshape it, pushing us toward what machines can’t touch: judgment, empathy, imagination.\nThis isn’t blind optimism. Disruption’s coming—some roles, like data entry or rote coding, might shrink fast. But new ones will sprout, just as web design boomed after the internet hit. The trick is seeing AI as a partner, not a rival. Businesses chasing full automation might cut costs short-term, but the real winners—like Starbucks or Mount Sinai—are betting on enhancement. They’re asking: How do we supercharge our people? Not: How do we swap them out?\nFor investors, this flips the script. Forget betting on AI to usurp humans—look for firms pairing tech with talent. For workers, it’s about leaning into what AI can’t do—solving the “what” while it handles the “how.” For policymakers, it’s crafting rules that keep humans in the driver’s seat, not the backseat.\nThe chapters ahead dig deeper. We’ll unpack AI’s guts (Chapter 2), spotlight what humans uniquely bring (Chapter 3), and map how this plays out across industries (Chapters 5-9). But the thread starts here: the future isn’t AI alone—it’s us, enhanced. That’s not a guess. It’s what the evidence, from ATMs to algorithms, keeps shouting.",

    "text": "1.6 The Current Thing\nChatGPT’s 2022 debut lit a match under AI hype. Suddenly, everyone had a taste—students cheating essays, coders auto-fixing bugs, execs dreaming of leaner payrolls. Stock tickers glowed green; pundits split between rapture and dread. But peel back the buzz, and the pattern’s familiar. At a Midwest ad agency, an AI tool churned out taglines in 2023—snappy, sure, but clients balked. They wanted ideas that felt human, not just sounded clever. The agency didn’t ditch copywriters; it paired them with AI to brainstorm faster, then refine with soul.\nThat’s the real story unfolding—not replacement, but retooling. AI’s rewriting the “how” of work, not the “why” or “what.” The firms getting it—like that agency, or UPS, or Pixar—aren’t automating people away. They’re amplifying what makes us irreplaceable.

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 The Emperor’s New Statistics\nArtificial intelligence is a broad field which long-time researchers often jokingly define as “anything computers can’t do yet.” From early grammar checkers to chess to facial recognition, many features that are now routine were once considered AI. No doubt the same will eventually be said of the new generation of large language models (LLMs), the more precise term to describe the impressive new tools that include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\nUnder the hood, these systems are less magical than they first appear. Today’s LLMs are based on a straightforward application of an optimization algorithm called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) invented by Google researchers in 2017. While the implementation details involve complex mathematics, the core concept is surprisingly simple: predict what words are most likely to come next in a sequence based on patterns observed in vast amounts of text.\nYou can think of LLMs as massively optimized and expanded versions of the auto-complete feature your smartphone has offered for years. Instead of proposing the next word or two, these models can generate full sentences, paragraphs, books, and on and on without limit. Their power comes from the GPT optimization that lets them take advantage of the massively-parallel architecture of graphic processing units (GPUs). Just as a graphical image can be broken into smaller pixels, each manipulated in parallel, LLMs break text documents into characters (or “tokens”) that are processed simultaneously within the GPU.\nThe result is an impressive pattern-matching system that can mimic human-written text with remarkable fidelity—but without the understanding that underlies human communication. When ChatGPT writes a paragraph that sounds like Ernest Hemingway, it’s not channeling Hemingway’s artistic vision or life experiences. It’s generating text based on statistical patterns it observed in Hemingway’s writing and similar texts. The model has no concept of fishing, bullfighting, war, or any other experiences that shaped Hemingway’s distinctive voice. It’s merely producing words that, statistically speaking, are likely to follow one another in a Hemingway-like manner.",

    "text": "2.2 One-Way Streets: The Critical Limitation of LLMs\nThe GPT algorithm has one critical limitation that explains many of its failures: once set in motion, it cannot backtrack. Humans plan ahead, weigh different scenarios, and can change their minds based on foreseen alternatives. GPTs can only fake this planning ability through their access to mountains of data where such alternatives have already been explored.\nThink of how you would solve a Sudoku puzzle. You might place a number in a cell, then work through several more cells before realizing your initial choice led to a contradiction. No problem—you backtrack, erase the number, and try a different approach. This recursive thinking process is fundamental to human problem-solving. But LLMs cannot do this. They generate text one token at a time, with no ability to revise earlier decisions based on later realizations.\nThis limitation explains why LLMs struggle with tasks that humans find relatively straightforward. They cannot do Sudoku, or handle chess positions not covered in their training data. Similarly, although they may appear to evaluate potential investment scenarios, they are merely generating plausible-sounding text based on patterns they’ve observed in financial discussions. They cannot truly consider alternative futures or change their analysis midstream.\nThis lack of genuine reasoning capability is why it would be wise to take AI predictions with considerable caution. Because they have no concept of imagining how a future situation might change current plans, they cannot truly engage in the kind of counterfactual thinking that underpins human judgment.",

    "section": "2.3 Inside the Training Process",
    "text": "2.3 Inside the Training Process\nLLMs are models that compress vast amounts of human knowledge—written, spoken, images, video—into a format that can generate similar-seeming content when given a starting prompt. Although the final models themselves are small enough to fit on a laptop or smartphone, they are created through a training process that consumes massive amounts of data—virtually everything on the public internet, plus collections of text from millions of books, magazines, academic journals, patent filings, and anything else their creators can find.\nThanks to the clever, time-saving shortcut discovered in the 2017 GPT algorithm, key parts of the training happen in parallel, limited only by the number of GPUs available. It is this optimization that explains the mad rush to buy GPUs, the chief beneficiary of which is Nvidia, thanks to its decades-long leadership in these fast processors. Although Nvidia chips were originally designed for fast graphics, their wide adoption means that many engineers are well-acquainted with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), the low-level graphics programming software that powers Nvidia devices. When designing the various implementations of GPT, it was natural for developers to optimize for CUDA, further cementing Nvidia’s lead.\nOnce trained, the LLM is a statistical prediction engine that knows the most likely word, phrase, or paragraphs that follow any given input. It knows, for example, that the phrase “Mary had a little” is highly likely to be followed by “lamb” or even the entire phrase “Its fleece was white as snow.” It will apply the same statistical completion algorithm to any snippet of text, including those that look like questions, where the most likely “completion” is the answer to the question. The statistically most likely way to complete the phrase “what is 1 + 1?” is “2.”\nThe final LLM consists of billions of “parameters,” finely-tuned statistical values created during the training process. But generating the response to your input requires similar levels of prodigious machine power. In fact, every character you type into the ChatGPT input box, as well as every character it types back, goes through many billions of computations. That slight delay you see as each character comes back at your terminal is not a clever UX (user experience) effect intended to appear like a human is typing the answer. In fact, the characters come out slowly because of the untold levels of computing power required to generate each one of them. Multiply this by the many millions of simultaneous ChatGPT users and you can understand why state-of-the-art LLMs are phenomenally expensive to operate.",

    "text": "2.4 What Does the Training Data Include?\nThe datasets used to train LLMs are enormous and diverse. OpenAI’s GPT-4, for example, was trained on hundreds of billions of words, including:\n\nThe vast majority of the public internet, including websites, forums, and social media\nMillions of books, from classic literature to modern non-fiction\nScientific papers and academic journals\nCode repositories and technical documentation\nNews articles and government documents\n\nThis massive corpus allows the model to encounter language used in countless contexts, enabling it to generate text that mimics a wide range of styles and domains. However, this approach also has significant limitations. The training data inevitably contains biases, inaccuracies, and outdated information that get encoded into the model’s parameters. And because the model has no understanding of the content—only statistical patterns—it cannot distinguish between reliable sources and misinformation.\nFurthermore, while the model’s training data is vast, it’s still finite and frozen at a specific point in time. This creates what’s called a “knowledge cutoff”—a date beyond which the model has no information. Any developments, events, or publications after this date are completely unknown to the model unless specifically provided in the conversation.\n\n\n\nChatGPT is trained on vast text sources, a distillation of most human knowledge.",

    "text": "2.5 Models Learning from Models: The Recursive Training Problem\nAn increasingly troubling issue is the growing proportion of AI-generated content on the internet. As LLMs produce more and more text that gets published online, newer models are increasingly training on outputs from older models rather than authentic human expression. This creates a recursive problem—models learning from models learning from models—potentially amplifying biases and errors with each generation.\nResearcher Ilia Shumailov at the University of Cambridge calls this phenomenon “the curse of recursion,” and it presents a fundamental challenge to the current approach of training AI on internet data. As AI-generated content proliferates, distinguishing authentic human expression from synthetic text becomes increasingly difficult. This recursion problem potentially undermines the very foundation of LLM training by gradually diluting the human element in the training data.",

    "text": "2.6 Beyond Text Completion: Fine-Tuning for Specific Tasks\nWhile base LLMs are essentially sophisticated text prediction engines, they can be adapted for specific purposes through a process called fine-tuning. This involves additional training on specialized datasets with human feedback to optimize the model for particular tasks or to align its outputs with human values.\nFor example, the base GPT model might generate toxic or harmful content if that’s what the statistical patterns in its training data suggest. To address this, OpenAI and other companies employ techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), where human evaluators rate different model outputs, and these ratings are used to further train the model to produce more helpful, harmless, and honest responses.\nThis fine-tuning process represents a crucial point of human intervention in the AI pipeline. The values and judgments of the human evaluators directly shape what kinds of responses the model will prioritize. However, this process also introduces new challenges, including the potential for evaluator biases to become magnified in the model’s behavior and the difficulty of clearly defining concepts like “helpful” or “harmful” across diverse cultural contexts.",

Despite their impressive capabilities, today’s AI systems have several fundamental limitations:\n\nNo Understanding or Consciousness: LLMs process patterns without understanding meaning. They have no consciousness, beliefs, desires, or intentions. They cannot truly understand concepts like justice, beauty, or truth—they can only mimic how humans talk about these concepts.\nNo Backtracking or Planning: As mentioned earlier, LLMs cannot revise earlier parts of their generation based on later realizations. They cannot truly plan ahead or engage in the kind of recursive thinking that humans employ naturally.\nNo Reality Grounding: LLMs have no direct access to physical reality. Their knowledge comes entirely from text and images in their training data, not from embodied experience in the world. They cannot verify facts against reality, only against patterns in their training data.\nNo Self-Improvement: While LLMs can be updated by their creators, they cannot improve themselves through experience. Each interaction is essentially fresh—the model doesn’t learn from its mistakes or successes across conversations.\nNo Originality: LLMs can combine and recombine elements from their training data in new ways, but they cannot create truly original concepts. They are fundamentally derivative, limited by what they’ve seen before.\n\nThese limitations explain why LLMs, despite their impressive text generation capabilities, fail at tasks requiring genuine understanding, counterfactual reasoning, or creative leaps beyond their training data.",

When we generate language, solve problems, or make decisions, we do far more than pattern matching. We understand the world through embodied experience, can plan recursively, and can imagine counterfactual scenarios. We can backtrack, revise our thinking, and make creative leaps beyond what we’ve previously encountered.\nConsider how a skilled financial analyst evaluates an investment opportunity. They don’t simply pattern-match against previous investments; they consider unique aspects of the current situation, imagine various future scenarios, and continuously revise their analysis as new information emerges. They bring judgment based on embodied experience in the world—something no LLM can replicate.\nThis is why the most effective applications of AI don’t attempt to replace human judgment but rather to enhance it. When AI handles the pattern-matching tasks it excels at, humans are freed to focus on the aspects of work that require judgment, creativity, and understanding.",

    "text": "2.9 The Balance: Where Humans and AI Excel\nThe most successful implementations of AI technology recognize the complementary strengths of humans and machines. AI demonstrates remarkable capability in processing vast amounts of data quickly and identifying patterns across large datasets that would overwhelm human attention. It excels in generating content based on statistical regularities, performing repetitive tasks with unwavering consistency, and operating continuously without the fatigue that limits human performance.\nHumans, meanwhile, bring fundamentally different strengths to the table. We understand context and meaning in ways that transcend statistical correlation. We make ethical judgments that require balancing competing values and considering impacts that may not be quantifiable. Our ability to think recursively and counterfactually—to imagine “what if” scenarios and revise our thinking—allows us to navigate novel situations with a flexibility that AI cannot match. Perhaps most importantly, humans can create truly novel concepts and approaches, and adapt to unprecedented situations by drawing on embodied experience and cross-domain knowledge.\nBy designing systems that leverage these complementary capabilities, organizations can achieve outcomes superior to what either humans or AI could accomplish alone. A human financial analyst with AI assistance, for instance, can process market data at unprecedented scale while maintaining the judgment needed to contextualize that data within broader economic and political realities. This synergy of human and artificial intelligence is the essence of the enhancement thesis we explore throughout this book.",

Automated systems that attempt to replace human judgment entirely run up against the fundamental limitations of pattern matching. Enhancement approaches that combine AI’s computational power with human judgment and creativity can deliver superior results.\nFor investors, this insight suggests focusing on companies that understand the complementary nature of human and artificial intelligence rather than those promising full automation.

    "title": "3  The What-How Divide",
    "section": "3.4 Real-World Examples",
    "text": "3.4 Real-World Examples\nLet’s look at some specific examples of how this “what vs. how” divide plays out:\n\n3.4.1 ChatGPT and Chess: The What vs. How Divide\nChatGPT excels at the “how” aspects of chess. It can explain rules with precise clarity, describe tactical motifs like forks and pins, recommend standard opening principles, and even execute move sequences when prompted. This “how” capability stems from its training on countless chess books, articles, and game annotations, allowing it to mimic the instructional patterns of chess literature.\nWhere ChatGPT fundamentally falls short is in the “what” domain of chess. It cannot determine what strategic approach makes sense in a complex position, what long-term plan to pursue, or what the most critical elements of a position are. Even more fundamentally, ChatGPT cannot decide what it means to “play chess well” in the first place.\nConsider a simple example: in a given position, should a player sacrifice material for an attack? This decision requires weighing potential attacking chances against concrete defensive resources - a judgment that integrates evaluation of multiple possible futures. ChatGPT can explain how sacrifices work in general, but cannot reliably determine what sacrifice (if any) is appropriate in a specific complex position.\nEven more telling is ChatGPT’s inability to set appropriate chess goals. A human must instruct the AI to “find checkmate in two moves” or “evaluate this position” or “recommend an opening for a beginner.” The AI cannot independently determine what chess problems are worth solving or what chess knowledge would benefit a particular player. It lacks the purposeful orientation that human players naturally bring to the game.\nThis mirrors the broader pattern we’ve observed across domains. AI systems like ChatGPT handle the mechanics - the “how” - with impressive competence. But they remain tools awaiting human direction regarding “what” goals to pursue, “what” problems need solving, and “what” considerations matter most in any given context.\nFor chess learners, this creates an interesting dynamic. ChatGPT can serve as an always-available resource for understanding “how” chess pieces move, “how” to execute basic tactics, and “how” traditional openings proceed. But determining “what” to study, “what” skills to prioritize, and “what” strategic approaches align with one’s strengths - these remain distinctly human judgments that no current AI can meaningfully address.\nThe limitations become even more apparent in competitive contexts. Strong human players know that chess is not merely about following rules and recognizing patterns - it’s about making judgments under uncertainty, having a coherent vision of how the game should develop, and understanding which factors deserve attention in ambiguous positions. These “what” decisions remain beyond ChatGPT’s capabilities, even as it continues to improve at describing “how” chess concepts work in isolation.\nAs AI capabilities advance, this fundamental divide persists. The most valuable human contribution isn’t executing the mechanical aspects of chess, but rather making the judgment calls about what matters, what deserves attention, and what goals are worth pursuing in the first place.\n\n\n3.4.2 Book-Writing: When Bulldozers Move Words\nWhat’s the value of traditional books when ChatGPT can generate coherent answers to any question?\nA good analogy is with construction projects. Like bulldozers that efficiently move earth, AI can rapidly generate vast quantities of coherent text. But just as construction requires both heavy machinery and skilled artisans, meaningful books need both AI’s raw productive power and human refinement.\nHowever, a well-crafted book offers something different: a carefully structured approach that helps readers decide their level of engagement. The finite, constrained nature of a book provides focus that chatbots, with their endless potential for digression, cannot easily match.\nThe key to understanding AI’s role in authorship lies in recognizing the distinct phases of book creation.\n\nThe initial phase - deciding subject matter and scope, aka the “what” phase — remains fundamentally human. While AI can help brainstorm ideas or identify underexplored topics, the essential creative spark and purpose must come from human intention. This reflects a broader truth about AI: it excels at processing existing patterns but struggles to generate truly novel directions.\nThe next phase — outlining the subject into smaller, related topics that make a coherent whole — demonstrates the potential for human-AI collaboration. AI can quickly generate comprehensive topic structures, but human expertise is crucial for identifying gaps, inconsistencies, or areas requiring special emphasis. This interplay between AI’s broad pattern recognition and human domain knowledge creates stronger frameworks than either could achieve alone.\nThe writing phase is where AI’s “bulldozer” capabilities shine. Instead of laboriously crafting individual sentences, authors can use AI to generate substantial blocks of coherent text. This dramatically accelerates the initial draft process. However, like rough-graded earth, this AI-generated text requires careful refinement to achieve its final form.\nThe refinement phase is where human judgment becomes paramount. Authors must shape the AI-generated content to maintain consistent voice, ensure logical flow, and preserve the book’s core purpose. This requires understanding nuances of audience expectations and subject matter that current AI systems cannot fully grasp.\n\nThis iterative process of generation and refinement continues until the project achieves its goals - another judgment that requires human evaluation. The result is neither purely AI-generated nor traditionally human-authored, but rather a new form of hybrid creativity that leverages the strengths of both.\nThe role of books may evolve, but their fundamental purpose - to present structured, focused exploration of subjects - will always be valuable. The challenge for authors is not to compete with AI’s raw generative capabilities, but to use them effectively while maintaining the human elements that give books their lasting value.\nThis suggests a future where successful authors are those who master the art of AI collaboration rather than resist it. Just as modern architects must understand both traditional design principles and computer-aided tools, tomorrow’s authors will need to balance classic writing skills with AI capabilities.\nThe key question is no longer whether AI will replace human authors, but how it will transform the authorship process. The answer lies in recognizing that while AI can move mountains of words, humans must still decide which mountains to move and how to shape the resulting landscape.\nThis transformation parallels broader changes in knowledge work. As AI handles more routine cognitive tasks, human value increasingly derives from higher-order skills like judgment, creativity, and strategic thinking. The greatest rewards of authorship, as in many professional fields, will accrue to those who can effectively combine human insight with AI capabilities.\nThe rise of AI authors doesn’t diminish the value of books but rather changes how they’re created. The essential human elements - purpose, judgment, refinement - remain crucial, even as AI dramatically expands our capability to generate and process information. The result may be not just better books, but new forms of knowledge sharing that we’re only beginning to imagine.",

    "section": "3.5 More examples",
    "text": "3.5 More examples\n\n3.5.1 Software Development: Beyond Code Generation\nThe construction industry provides useful analogies for understanding AI’s impact on software development. Just as modern construction sites use both automated machinery and skilled human workers, software development is evolving into a hybrid process where AI handles routine coding tasks while humans focus on architecture and design decisions.\nThink of a typical software project. Traditional development required writing every line of code manually, like building a house brick by brick. Now, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer can generate entire functions or modules automatically, similar to how prefabricated components accelerated construction. These AI tools excel at producing standard elements - authentication systems, database queries, API endpoints - just as manufacturing automation excels at producing standardized building materials.\nHowever, like construction projects, software development involves more than assembling standard components. A successful project requires understanding user needs, designing intuitive interfaces, ensuring security, and maintaining long-term reliability. These higher-level decisions remain firmly in human territory.\nThe architectural parallel is particularly apt. Just as architects must consider aesthetics, functionality, and structural integrity, software architects must balance user experience, system performance, and code maintainability. AI can suggest implementation details, but it cannot determine whether a feature aligns with business goals or how it might affect user behavior.\nTechnical debt offers another illuminating comparison. In construction, taking shortcuts (like using lower-grade materials) can speed completion but creates future maintenance problems. Similarly, in software development, quick fixes and temporary solutions accumulate as technical debt. While AI can identify potential debt and suggest refactoring strategies, humans must weigh the business tradeoffs of addressing it now versus later.\nIntegration challenges further highlight AI’s limitations. Modern software systems are complex ecosystems of interacting components, like cities with interconnected infrastructure systems. AI excels at optimizing individual components but struggles to understand system-wide implications. Humans must orchestrate these interactions, ensuring different parts work together coherently while maintaining system reliability and performance.\nSecurity considerations demonstrate another crucial human role. Like building security systems, software security requires anticipating potential threats and implementing appropriate protections. AI can identify common vulnerabilities and suggest fixes, but it cannot understand the broader security context or evaluate risk tradeoffs. These decisions require human judgment informed by business context and threat assessment.\nThe testing and quality assurance phase reveals both AI’s strengths and limitations. AI tools can automatically generate test cases and identify potential bugs, similar to automated building inspections. However, human testers are still essential for evaluating user experience, identifying edge cases, and ensuring the software meets business requirements. AI can verify that code works as written, but humans must verify it works as intended.\nLooking ahead, successful software development will likely become increasingly collaborative between humans and AI. Development teams will need to master new workflows that leverage AI’s capabilities while maintaining human oversight of critical decisions. This might involve using AI for initial code generation and routine maintenance while focusing human effort on architecture, security, and user experience.\nThis evolution parallels broader trends in professional work. Just as power tools didn’t eliminate the need for skilled carpenters but changed how they work, AI won’t eliminate software developers but will transform their role. The most valuable developers will be those who can effectively direct AI tools while maintaining high-level system understanding.\nThe implications for software education and training are significant. Future developers will need less emphasis on memorizing syntax and more focus on system design, architecture, and AI collaboration skills. This mirrors how modern architectural education focuses less on manual drafting and more on design principles and computer-aided tools.\nHowever, the fundamental role of human creativity and judgment remains unchanged. Just as beautiful buildings require human vision despite advanced construction technology, great software requires human insight despite sophisticated AI tools. The key is understanding AI as an enabler of human creativity rather than its replacement. AI working alone can be competent at creating an adequate building that meets the programmatic requirements laid out by its developers, but a truly great building will still require human input and humans’ ability to push the frontier of creativity.\nThis suggests that software development is entering a new phase where success depends on effectively combining AI capabilities with human insight. Here again, the best outcomes will result from humans’ ability to leverage AI. The winners will be those who can best envision how technology can serve human needs while using AI to implement that vision efficiently and reliably.\nIn this new paradigm, the measure of a developer shifts from lines of code written to the effectiveness of their human-AI collaboration in creating valuable software solutions. The construction industry’s evolution from manual labor to machine-assisted craftsmanship provides a roadmap for this transformation.\n\n\n3.5.2 Investment Analysis: Beyond the Numbers\nJust as modern factories use automation for routine manufacturing while relying on human expertise for product design and quality control, investment analysis is evolving into a hybrid process where AI handles data processing while humans focus on strategic insights and judgment calls.\nLet’s think of a typical investment analysis project. Traditionally, analysts spent countless hours gathering financial data, creating comparison spreadsheets, and writing preliminary reports. Now, AI can instantly process quarterly reports, generate peer comparisons, and draft initial analyses. This is similar to how automated assembly lines handle routine manufacturing tasks, freeing human workers to focus on complex problems requiring judgment and creativity.\nHowever, like manufacturing, successful investing involves more than processing standard inputs. While AI excels at identifying patterns in financial statements and market data, it struggles with crucial qualitative factors. Can management be trusted? Is the company’s competitive advantage sustainable? Will current market opportunities persist? These questions require human judgment informed by experience and industry knowledge.\nThe manufacturing quality control parallel is particularly relevant. Just as experienced inspectors can spot subtle defects that automated systems miss, seasoned investors can identify red flags in management behavior or market dynamics that AI might overlook. A CEO’s body language during earnings calls, the timing of insider stock sales, or subtle shifts in competitive dynamics - these nuanced signals often prove more valuable than quantitative metrics.\nCompetitive analysis offers another illuminating comparison. In manufacturing, understanding market dynamics requires more than analyzing production statistics - it requires insight into changing consumer preferences, emerging technologies, and competitor strategies. Similarly, while AI can process vast amounts of market data, humans must evaluate whether a company’s competitive position is truly defensible and whether management’s strategy aligns with market realities.\nThe role of trust highlights another crucial human element. Just as manufacturing partnerships require trust built through personal relationships and demonstrated reliability, investment success often depends on accurately assessing management credibility. AI can flag inconsistencies in financial statements or unusual transaction patterns, but it cannot evaluate character or judge whether explanations for apparent irregularities are credible.\nMarket opportunity assessment demonstrates similar limitations. Like evaluating new manufacturing technologies, assessing market opportunities requires understanding both technical capabilities and human behavior. AI can analyze historical market data and identify trends, but it cannot predict how human customers, competitors, and regulators will react to new situations. These predictions require human insight into psychology and social dynamics.\nRisk assessment reveals both AI’s strengths and limitations. AI systems can quickly identify common risk factors and calculate standard metrics, similar to automated safety systems in manufacturing. However, the most significant risks often come from unexpected directions that don’t appear in historical data. Human judgment remains essential for identifying and evaluating these non-obvious risks.\nLooking ahead, successful investment analysis will likely become increasingly collaborative between humans and AI. Analysis teams will need to master new workflows that leverage AI’s data processing capabilities while maintaining human oversight of critical judgments. This might involve using AI for initial screening and routine monitoring while focusing human effort on qualitative assessment and strategic thinking.\nThis evolution parallels broader trends in professional work. Automation did not eliminate the need for skilled manufacturing workers but changed their role, and AI will not eliminate investment analysts but will transform how they work. The most valuable analysts will be those who can effectively direct AI tools while maintaining deep industry understanding and judgment capabilities.\nThe implications for investment education and training are significant. Future analysts will need less emphasis on spreadsheet skills and more focus on business judgment and AI collaboration capabilities. This mirrors how modern manufacturing education focuses less on manual skills and more on process management and technology integration.\nHowever, the fundamental role of human judgment remains unchanged. Just as quality manufacturing requires human oversight despite advanced automation, successful investing requires human insight despite sophisticated AI tools. The key is understanding AI as an enhancer of human judgment rather than its replacement.\nThis suggests that investment analysis is entering a new phase where success depends on effectively combining AI capabilities with human insight. Analysts who can best understand business fundamentals while using AI will perform better than those who can merely process data faster.\nIn this new paradigm, the measure of an analyst shifts from computational speed to the effectiveness of their human-AI collaboration in identifying truly attractive investments. The manufacturing industry’s evolution from manual production to technology-enhanced craftsmanship provides a roadmap for this transformation.\n\n\n3.5.3 AI and Healthcare: Beyond Pattern Recognition\nThe evolution of AI in healthcare parallels modern manufacturing quality control, where automated systems handle routine inspections while skilled technicians focus on complex problems requiring human judgment. Similarly, healthcare is becoming a hybrid system where AI processes medical data while human doctors focus on patient relationships and complex medical decisions.\nConsider a typical diagnostic process. Traditionally, doctors spent considerable time reviewing test results, consulting medical literature, and documenting findings. Now, AI can instantly analyze lab results, medical images, and patient histories to suggest potential diagnoses. This is similar to how automated inspection systems quickly identify defects in manufactured products, allowing human inspectors to focus on more complex quality issues.\nHowever, like quality control, successful healthcare involves more than pattern recognition. While AI excels at identifying anomalies in test results and suggesting standard treatments, it struggles with crucial contextual factors. How will a patient’s living situation affect treatment adherence? Which side effects are acceptable given a patient’s lifestyle? What treatment modifications are needed given other health conditions? These questions require human judgment informed by direct patient interaction and medical experience.\nThe empathy factor is particularly relevant. Effective quality control requires understanding how products will be used in real-world conditions, and effective healthcare requires understanding patients’ lives and concerns. AI can process medical histories and suggest treatment protocols, but it cannot truly empathize with patient fears or understand how cultural and personal factors might affect treatment success.\nTreatment customization offers another illuminating comparison. In manufacturing, standard quality metrics must often be adjusted for specific use cases. Similarly, while AI can recommend standard treatments based on medical literature, doctors must adapt these recommendations to individual patient circumstances. A treatment protocol that looks optimal on paper might be impractical or inappropriate given a patient’s specific situation.\nThe trust relationship highlights another crucial human element. In the same way that manufacturing quality depends on trust between suppliers and customers, healthcare outcomes often depend on patient trust in their medical providers. AI can provide accurate medical information, but it cannot build the personal trust that encourages treatment compliance and honest symptom reporting.\nEmergency response demonstrates both AI’s strengths and limitations. AI systems can quickly process vital signs and suggest immediate interventions, similar to automated safety systems in manufacturing. However, emergency medicine often requires split-second decisions based on incomplete information and complex tradeoffs. Human judgment remains essential for these high-stakes decisions where standard protocols may not apply.\nLooking ahead, successful healthcare will likely become increasingly collaborative between humans and AI. Medical teams will need to master new workflows that leverage AI’s analytical capabilities while maintaining human oversight of critical decisions. This might involve using AI for initial screening and routine monitoring while focusing human effort on patient interaction and complex case management.\nThis evolution parallels broader trends in professional work. Automation did not eliminate the need for skilled quality control technicians but changed their role, and AI will not eliminate doctors but will transform how they work. The most valuable healthcare providers will be those who can effectively direct AI tools while maintaining strong patient relationships and clinical judgment.\nThe implications for medical education and training are significant. Future doctors will need less emphasis on memorizing medical facts and more focus on patient communication and AI collaboration skills. This mirrors how modern quality control training focuses less on inspection procedures and more on system management and problem-solving.\nHowever, the fundamental role of human judgment remains unchanged. Quality control requires human oversight despite advanced inspection technology, and healthcare requires human insight despite sophisticated AI tools. The key is understanding AI as an enhancer of medical judgment rather than its replacement.\nThis suggests that healthcare is entering a new phase where success depends on effectively combining AI capabilities with human insight. Those who can understand patient needs while using AI to enhance this understanding will reap more rewards than those who can merely recall the most medical facts and procedures.\nIn this new paradigm, the measure of a healthcare provider shifts from diagnostic speed to the effectiveness of their human-AI collaboration in achieving optimal patient outcomes. The quality control industry’s evolution from manual inspection to technology-enhanced oversight provides a roadmap for this transformation.\nThe challenge ahead is not whether to adopt AI in healthcare, but how to integrate it while preserving the human elements that make medicine effective. Success will require understanding both AI’s capabilities and its limitations, while never losing sight of healthcare’s fundamental mission: helping human patients achieve better health outcomes through personalized, compassionate care.",

The most successful AI implementations will be those that augment rather than replace human capabilities, allowing people to focus on the high-value what decisions where they maintain a durable advantage.\nThis perspective offers a useful corrective to the common investor tendency to overvalue pure automation plays.

    "text": "3.7 The Evolution of Knowledge Work\nAs AI capabilities continue to evolve, we can anticipate further shifts in the relative value of different forms of human contribution. Implementation skills—the how—will continue to be commoditized, while strategic judgment—the what—will command an increasing premium. This doesn’t mean implementation expertise becomes irrelevant, but rather that it must be paired with higher-level strategic capabilities to remain valuable.\nFor individual knowledge workers, this suggests a clear direction for professional development. Rather than focusing exclusively on technical mastery within narrow domains, sustainable career advancement will require developing broader strategic capabilities: understanding stakeholder needs, synthesizing insights across disciplines, and making nuanced judgments that integrate technical, business, and ethical considerations.\nFor educational institutions, the what-how divide suggests the need for fundamental curriculum redesign. Traditional education systems heavily emphasize how skills—teaching specific methodologies, tools, and techniques. Future-oriented education should place greater emphasis on developing students’ abilities to frame problems effectively, think across disciplinary boundaries, and make contextual judgments that cannot be easily automated.\nFor policymakers, this framework offers a more nuanced understanding of AI’s impact on employment and economic opportunity. Rather than focusing exclusively on potential job displacement, policy approaches should consider how to facilitate the transition toward work that emphasizes uniquely human strategic capabilities while ensuring that the benefits of AI-driven productivity gains are broadly shared.",

    "text": "3.8 Integration with Enhancement Thesis\nThe what-how framework aligns perfectly with our core thesis that AI will enhance rather than replace human capabilities across industries. By automating routine implementation tasks, AI frees human cognitive capacity for higher-level strategic thinking—the domain where human judgment maintains a durable advantage. This represents not replacement but enhancement of human potential.\nThis perspective also explains why purely automated approaches often disappoint. When AI systems operate without appropriate human direction and oversight, they may execute flawlessly within their parameters while completely missing the broader context that gives their outputs meaning and value. The most successful implementations maintain humans “in the loop” precisely because human judgment about what matters cannot be delegated to automated systems.\nIn the case of full self-driving technology, which we’ll explore more fully in later chapters, companies like Tesla have collected unprecedented amounts of driving data and developed increasingly sophisticated systems for navigating complex environments. Yet as robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has observed, these systems still struggle with the contextual judgment that experienced human drivers exercise effortlessly.\nA human driver approaching a neighborhood with cars parked tightly on both sides naturally slows down, recognizing the increased risk of children darting into the street. This judgment doesn’t derive from explicit rules but from a holistic understanding of context that integrates multiple factors—some explicit, others tacit. Autonomous systems may eventually replicate this behavior through sophisticated pattern recognition, but they cannot independently determine which factors deserve attention without human direction.",

Rather than wholesale replacement, we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in the nature of human contribution—from executing well-defined tasks to making strategic judgments about what deserves attention and how different considerations should be weighed.\nThis transformation presents both challenges and opportunities. Organizations and individuals that continue to focus exclusively on implementation skills will find their competitive position eroding as AI systems increasingly automate these functions. Those who develop the strategic judgment to determine what is worth doing—and the ability to direct AI systems effectively toward these ends—will thrive in an AI-enhanced economy.\nThe what-how framework aligns with our broader thesis that successful AI implementation requires keeping humans “in the loop.” Not because of temporary technical limitations that will eventually be overcome, but because of fundamental differences between human and artificial intelligence. The most valuable human contributions have always involved more than technical execution—they reflect purpose, meaning, and judgment that remain uniquely human even as AI capabilities advance.\nIn the next chapter, we’ll explore these philosophical dimensions more deeply, examining why understanding the nature of human intelligence is crucial for designing effective human-AI collaborations. By recognizing both the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence, we can develop approaches that truly enhance human potential rather than attempting to replace it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: What-How Matrix",

    "section": "3.10 Beyond the False Binary",
    "text": "3.10 Beyond the False Binary\nThe current discourse on AI’s impact falls into a tiresome and inaccurate binary: either AI will replace human workers entirely, or its effects will be marginal. Both narratives miss the fundamental transformation underway. What we’re witnessing is not wholesale replacement but a profound shift in the nature of human contribution—a redistribution of value across the knowledge work spectrum that redefines which human capabilities command a premium.\nThis transformation becomes apparent when we distinguish between two fundamental aspects of any intellectual task: determining what needs to be done versus executing how to do it. This distinction, while seemingly straightforward, carries profound implications for the future of work, business strategy, and investment that extend far beyond the simplistic replacement narrative dominating public discourse.\nThe what-how framework offers remarkable clarity amid the confusing narratives surrounding AI. It helps explain why certain cognitive tasks are rapidly becoming commoditized while others remain stubbornly resistant to automation. More importantly, it provides a roadmap for individuals, organizations, and policymakers navigating a landscape where artificial intelligence increasingly pervades knowledge work.\nUntil the arrival of generative AI, individuals gained professional advantages through superior “how” skills—they excelled at crafting compelling presentations, building complex spreadsheets, writing efficient code, or translating between languages. These implementation abilities represented valuable skills that could be developed and applied on behalf of those who determined what needed to be done.\nIn traditional organizational hierarchies, executives and managers typically decide what initiatives to pursue, while specialized knowledge workers determine how to execute them. This division has historically functioned efficiently because how expertise—whether in financial modeling, software development, or content creation—required significant investment in learning specialized tools and methodologies.\nThe emergence of sophisticated AI systems fundamentally alters this equation. Large language models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in implementation tasks, often exceeding human capabilities in narrow domains. They can generate code, compose business communications, create visual assets, and perform complex analyses with minimal human guidance. These systems excel precisely in the domain of how—the execution of well-defined tasks within established parameters.\nWhat these systems cannot do—and what remains uniquely human—is determine what is worth doing in the first place. They cannot independently identify which problems merit attention, which strategies align with organizational values, or which approaches will resonate with stakeholders. They lack the contextual understanding, ethical framework, and strategic vision required to make these determinations.\nAs noted already, the financial analyst traditionally created value from technical modeling skills. As AI systems increasingly automate complex financial calculations, the analyst’s competitive advantage shifts toward identifying which factors merit analysis, which comparisons yield strategic insights, and how findings translate into investment decisions. The technical implementation—the how—becomes commoditized, while judgment about what to analyze becomes the primary value driver.\nThis pattern repeats across knowledge work domains. In marketing, AI can generate endless variations of campaign materials, but cannot determine which messaging will align with brand values and audience expectations. In software development, AI can produce functional code based on specifications but cannot identify which features will deliver genuine user value. In healthcare, AI can analyze diagnostic images with remarkable accuracy but cannot integrate these findings with the full context of patient well-being.",

    "section": "3.11 Philosophical Dimensions of the Divide",
    "text": "3.11 Philosophical Dimensions of the Divide\nThe what-how divide resonates with deeper philosophical questions about the nature of intelligence and agency. Martin Heidegger, whose work we explore more fully in Chapter 4, offers particularly relevant insights through his concept of “comportments”—the way humans face and engage with the world around them.\nWhen we are deeply engaged in an activity—skillfully driving a car, playing an instrument, or writing code—we are not consciously thinking about the mechanics of these actions. Our focus extends beyond the immediate task to its purpose and meaning within our broader existence. The ultimate comportment, Heidegger suggests, is our orientation toward being itself, which encompasses our understanding of past, present, and future.\nArtificial intelligence systems, even sophisticated ones like GPT-4 or Claude, lack these comportments. They process information without any inherent purpose or temporal orientation. They can mimic human-like outputs but have no concept of why these outputs matter or how they fit into broader human concerns. This philosophical distinction manifests practically in AI’s inability to determine what is worth doing independent of human direction.\nThe what-how divide thus represents more than a practical delineation of tasks; it reflects a fundamental distinction between human and artificial intelligence. While AI excels at executing well-defined processes—the how—it cannot engage with the existential questions of purpose and meaning that inform human decisions about what deserves attention.\nThis philosophical perspective helps explain why LLMs struggle with certain seemingly simple tasks, as we demonstrated in prior chapters. Tasks that require constant re-evaluation and adjustment based on evolving goals—like writing a sentence that accurately describes its own length or completing a Sudoku puzzle—reveal the fundamental limitations of systems that cannot backtrack or reconsider their approach once they’ve begun generating outputs.",

    "section": "3.12 Case Studies: The Divide in Practice",
    "text": "3.12 Case Studies: The Divide in Practice\nTo illustrate the what-how divide, let’s examine several domains where this transformation is particularly evident:\n\n3.12.1 Software Development\nTraditional programming expertise focused heavily on implementation details—mastering specific languages, frameworks, and architectural patterns. While these technical skills remain valuable, AI code generation tools increasingly automate routine implementation tasks. The premium shifts toward determining which features will deliver value, how systems should interact with users, and what architectural decisions will support long-term business objectives.\nSenior developers report that junior programmers who once spent years mastering syntax and debugging techniques now leverage AI assistants to handle these aspects, allowing them to focus earlier in their careers on higher-level system design and user experience considerations—traditionally the domain of more experienced developers.\nThis shift alters the career progression trajectory for software engineers. Technical implementation skills remain necessary but insufficient; they must be paired with strategic judgment about what deserves implementation in the first place. Engineers who maintain purely technical focus without developing this broader perspective may find their competitive position eroding as AI systems increasingly automate routine coding tasks.\n\n\n3.12.2 Content Creation\nIn media and marketing, AI systems now generate remarkably coherent and stylistically appropriate content at scale. The limiting factor is no longer production capacity but strategic direction—determining which messages will resonate with target audiences, which topics deserve attention, and how content aligns with broader brand narratives.\nMarketing executives evaluating AI writing assistants frequently report that while these tools can “automatically compose email replies,” users typically spend as much time editing these drafts as they would creating responses from scratch. The real value emerges when humans with deep customer knowledge direct these tools toward specific strategic objectives.\nThis transformation extends beyond business communication to creative fields. As we explored with the AI-generated completion of Beethoven’s unfinished tenth symphony, technical proficiency alone cannot replicate the ineffable quality that distinguishes truly meaningful creative work. As music critic Jan Swafford observed, “We humans need to see the human doing it.” The value derives not just from the output itself but from knowing it represents authentic human struggle, insight, and purpose.\n\n\n3.12.3 Healthcare\nMedical diagnostic systems increasingly match or exceed human performance in analyzing medical images, identifying patterns in patient data, and suggesting potential diagnoses. Yet these systems cannot determine which factors are most relevant for a particular patient, how to weigh complex trade-offs between treatment options, or how to communicate findings in ways that respect patient values and preferences.\nA physician whose only skill is knowing how to diagnose a patient’s condition is becoming less necessary. The crucial human contribution shifts toward determining what aspects of patient wellbeing deserve priority, which treatment approaches align with patient values, and how to integrate medical insights with broader quality-of-life considerations.\nThis shift carries significant implications for medical education and practice. Technical diagnostic skills remain essential but must increasingly be paired with heightened capabilities for integrative judgment, ethical reasoning, and communication. The most effective healthcare practitioners of the future will leverage AI for routine analytical tasks while focusing their human expertise on the complex judgments that machines cannot make.",

As implementation capabilities become increasingly commoditized through AI, sustainable competitive advantage shifts toward superior judgment about what deserves implementation in the first place.\nThis dynamic particularly challenges organizations that have traditionally derived their advantage primarily from superior execution. When AI systems can implement strategies with comparable efficiency across competitors, the primary differentiator becomes the quality of strategic judgment guiding that implementation. Organizations must evolve their capabilities accordingly, developing institutional capacity for the complex judgments that remain resistant to automation.\nWe see this pattern emerging in investment management, where quantitative analysis tools have become increasingly sophisticated and widely available. The differentiator for successful investment firms shifts toward superior judgment about which factors merit analysis, which market signals deserve attention, and how various considerations should be weighted in decision-making.\nSimilarly, in management consulting, the technical aspects of data analysis and presentation—traditionally key components of the service offering—are increasingly automated. The value proposition shifts toward helping clients determine which problems deserve attention, which approaches align with organizational values, and how various factors should be prioritized.\nFor technology companies specifically, the what-how framework offers valuable guidance for product development.

    "text": "3.14 Organizational Implications\nThis fundamental shift carries significant implications for how organizations approach talent development, operational structure, and competitive strategy. Companies that recognize and adapt to the what-how divide will establish sustainable advantages in an AI-enhanced economy.\nFirst, talent development programs must evolve beyond technical training focused on implementation skills. While baseline technical literacy remains essential, organizations should invest more heavily in developing employees’ abilities to frame problems effectively, synthesize insights across domains, and make nuanced judgments that integrate technical, business, and ethical considerations.\nThe most valuable professional development initiatives will foster precisely those capabilities that remain distinctly human—contextual understanding, strategic synthesis, and ethical judgment. This represents a significant departure from traditional approaches that emphasize mastery of specific tools and methodologies.\nSecond, workflow design should consciously separate strategic decisions from implementation details, creating clear interfaces between human judgment and AI execution. This approach maintains appropriate human oversight while leveraging AI’s capabilities for rapid, consistent implementation.\nEffective workflow design requires careful consideration of where human judgment adds the most value. Rather than automating entire processes end-to-end, organizations should identify the critical decision points where human judgment remains essential and design workflows that explicitly incorporate this judgment while automating surrounding implementation steps.\nThird, organizational structures should evolve to emphasize roles that combine domain expertise with AI literacy. The traditional separation between business strategists and technical implementers becomes less valuable as AI systems increasingly bridge this gap. New hybrid roles will emerge that focus on translating business objectives into effective AI implementation approaches.\nThis structural evolution may require reconsidering traditional career paths and reporting relationships. Organizations that maintain rigid distinctions between technical and strategic roles may struggle to develop the integrated capabilities needed for effective human-AI collaboration.",

    "text": "3.15 Investment Implications\nFor investors, the what-how framework offers valuable guidance for evaluating AI-related opportunities. Companies positioned to win in this environment include those that:\n\nDevelop tools that enhance human strategic thinking rather than merely automating implementation tasks.\nCreate platforms that facilitate seamless collaboration between human judgment and AI execution.\nBuild solutions that maintain appropriate human oversight while leveraging AI capabilities.\nDesign business models that recognize and reward uniquely human contributions\n\nBy contrast, companies that focus exclusively on automation without considering the continued importance of human judgment will likely struggle to deliver sustainable value. The most successful AI implementations will be those that augment rather than replace human capabilities, allowing people to focus on the high-value what decisions where they maintain a durable advantage.\nThis perspective offers a useful corrective to the common investor tendency to overvalue pure automation plays. The history of technology adoption suggests that approaches that enhance rather than replace human capabilities typically deliver more sustainable value over time.",

    "text": "3.16 The Evolution of Knowledge Work\nAs AI capabilities continue to evolve, we can anticipate further shifts in the relative value of different forms of human contribution. Implementation skills—the how—will continue to be commoditized, while strategic judgment—the what—will command an increasing premium. This doesn’t mean implementation expertise becomes irrelevant, but rather that it must be paired with higher-level strategic capabilities to remain valuable.\nFor individual knowledge workers, this suggests a clear direction for professional development. Rather than focusing exclusively on technical mastery within narrow domains, sustainable career advancement will require developing broader strategic capabilities: understanding stakeholder needs, synthesizing insights across disciplines, and making nuanced judgments that integrate technical, business, and ethical considerations.\nFor educational institutions, the what-how divide suggests the need for fundamental curriculum redesign. Traditional education systems heavily emphasize how skills—teaching specific methodologies, tools, and techniques. Future-oriented education should place greater emphasis on developing students’ abilities to frame problems effectively, think across disciplinary boundaries, and make contextual judgments that cannot be easily automated.\nFor policymakers, this framework offers a more nuanced understanding of AI’s impact on employment and economic opportunity. Rather than focusing exclusively on potential job displacement, policy approaches should consider how to facilitate the transition toward work that emphasizes uniquely human strategic capabilities while ensuring that the benefits of AI-driven productivity gains are broadly shared.",

    "text": "3.17 Integration with Enhancement Thesis\nThe what-how framework aligns perfectly with our core thesis that AI will enhance rather than replace human capabilities across industries. By automating routine implementation tasks, AI frees human cognitive capacity for higher-level strategic thinking—the domain where human judgment maintains a durable advantage. This represents not replacement but enhancement of human potential.\nThis perspective also explains why purely automated approaches often disappoint. When AI systems operate without appropriate human direction and oversight, they may execute flawlessly within their parameters while completely missing the broader context that gives their outputs meaning and value. The most successful implementations maintain humans “in the loop” precisely because human judgment about what matters cannot be delegated to automated systems.\nIn the case of full self-driving technology, which we’ll explore more fully in later chapters, companies like Tesla have collected unprecedented amounts of driving data and developed increasingly sophisticated systems for navigating complex environments. Yet as robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks has observed, these systems still struggle with the contextual judgment that experienced human drivers exercise effortlessly.\nA human driver approaching a neighborhood with cars parked tightly on both sides naturally slows down, recognizing the increased risk of children darting into the street. This judgment doesn’t derive from explicit rules but from a holistic understanding of context that integrates multiple factors—some explicit, others tacit. Autonomous systems may eventually replicate this behavior through sophisticated pattern recognition, but they cannot independently determine which factors deserve attention without human direction.",

    "text": "3.18 Conclusion: Navigating the Transformation\nThe what-how divide provides a powerful framework for understanding AI’s true impact on knowledge work and business strategy. Rather than wholesale replacement, we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in the nature of human contribution—from executing well-defined tasks to making strategic judgments about what deserves attention and how different considerations should be weighed.\nThis transformation presents both challenges and opportunities. Organizations and individuals that continue to focus exclusively on implementation skills will find their competitive position eroding as AI systems increasingly automate these functions. Those who develop the strategic judgment to determine what is worth doing—and the ability to direct AI systems effectively toward these ends—will thrive in an AI-enhanced economy.\nThe what-how framework aligns with our broader thesis that successful AI implementation requires keeping humans “in the loop.” Not because of temporary technical limitations that will eventually be overcome, but because of fundamental differences between human and artificial intelligence. The most valuable human contributions have always involved more than technical execution—they reflect purpose, meaning, and judgment that remain uniquely human even as AI capabilities advance.\nIn the next chapter, we’ll explore these philosophical dimensions more deeply, examining why understanding the nature of human intelligence is crucial for designing effective human-AI collaborations. By recognizing both the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence, we can develop approaches that truly enhance human potential rather than attempting to replace it.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "4.1 Being-in-the-World: Heidegger’s Fundamental Insight\nPrevious chapters examined AI’s capabilities and limitations from technical and business perspectives. But to truly understand why human intelligence remains irreplaceable, we need to explore the philosophical underpinnings of intelligence itself. This requires venturing beyond the dominant analytical tradition of Anglo-American philosophy—with its focus on logic, language, and computation—into Continental philosophy, where thinkers like Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre grappled more directly with questions of being, consciousness, and embodied existence.\nThe prevailing narrative of artificial intelligence rests on a fundamental assumption inherited from Descartes: that intelligence is essentially computational. Descartes’ famous declaration, “I think, therefore I am,” positioned abstract reasoning as the defining characteristic of human existence. This Cartesian model frames the mind as a thinking mechanism separate from both body and world—a disembodied processor of information. The modern project of artificial intelligence follows directly from this conception: if human intelligence is fundamentally computational, then creating artificial intelligence simply requires building sufficiently sophisticated computational systems.\nBut what if this foundational assumption is wrong? What if human intelligence isn’t primarily computational at all, but emerges from our embodied, situated existence in the world? This is precisely the argument advanced by Heidegger and other Continental philosophers, and it is critical to our understanding of both human and artificial intelligence.\nHeidegger’s masterwork, Being and Time (1927), represents a radical departure from the Cartesian tradition. Where Descartes begins with the isolated, thinking subject, Heidegger starts with what he calls Dasein (literally “being-there”)—human existence characterized by its fundamental embeddedness in a meaningful world. For Heidegger, we are not primarily thinking beings who sometimes act in the world; we are fundamentally beings-in-the-world who occasionally step back to think abstractly.\nThis distinction may seem subtle, but its implications are profound. In the Cartesian model, our primary relationship to the world is one of detached observation and calculation—we represent the world internally and then compute appropriate responses. In Heidegger’s model, our primary relationship to the world is one of practical engagement—we are always already involved in meaningful situations that shape our perceptions, actions, and understanding.\nLet’s see how this plays out in skilled performance. A virtuoso pianist doesn’t mentally represent each note before playing it; she is absorbed in the activity itself, responding fluidly to the music as it unfolds. A seasoned trader doesn’t consciously calculate each market move; he intuitively reads patterns and responds with practiced expertise. Heidegger describes this mode of engagement as “ready-to-hand” (Zuhandenheit)—a state where tools and skills become extensions of ourselves rather than objects of conscious attention.\nThis ready-to-hand mode contrasts sharply with what Heidegger calls “present-at-hand” (Vorhandenheit)—the detached, analytical stance we adopt when something breaks down or becomes problematic. When the pianist hits a wrong note or the trader encounters an anomalous market pattern, they shift from absorbed engagement to conscious analysis. This analytical stance approximates the Cartesian model of detached representation, but for Heidegger, it’s a derived and secondary mode of engagement, not our primary way of being in the world.",

    "section": "4.2 Implications for Artificial Intelligence",
    "text": "4.2 Implications for Artificial Intelligence\nThis philosophical reframing has profound implications for artificial intelligence. Current AI systems—even sophisticated ones like large language models—operate entirely in the “present-at-hand” mode. They process information, identify patterns, and generate outputs based on statistical correlations, but they lack the capacity for “ready-to-hand” engagement with the world.\nThis limitation becomes apparent when we examine the capabilities and limitations of current AI systems. Recall the example from earlier chapters: large language models cannot “backtrack” or revise their fundamental assumptions mid-stream. When tasked with writing “a sentence that describes its own length in words,” they consistently fail despite their impressive pattern-recognition capabilities. This isn’t merely a technical limitation that future iterations will overcome; it reflects a more fundamental difference between computational processing and human understanding.\nHuman understanding emerges from our practical engagement with the world—what Heidegger calls our “pre-understanding” or “fore-structure of understanding.” We always approach situations with a tacit grasp of how things work, gained through our embodied experience in a shared world of meaning. This pre-understanding isn’t represented explicitly in propositional form; it’s woven into our very way of being in the world.\nAI systems lack this pre-understanding because they don’t inhabit the world as we do. They process information but don’t experience it in a meaningful context. This explains why AI systems can process vast amounts of text about human emotions without ever feeling them, or analyze countless images of objects without developing a practical understanding of how those objects function in everyday life.",

    "section": "4.3 Temporality and Human Understanding",
    "text": "4.3 Temporality and Human Understanding\nHeidegger further distinguishes human intelligence through his concept of temporality. For Heidegger, humans exist temporally—our understanding of the present is always shaped by our experience of the past and our projection toward the future. This temporal structure isn’t merely about placing events on a timeline; it’s about how past, present, and future interpenetrate in our lived experience.\nWhen a skilled investor makes decisions, he isn’t simply processing current data; he’s drawing on his lived experience of past market cycles and projecting potential futures based on that understanding. This temporality isn’t reducible to a database of past events plus a prediction algorithm. It’s a unified structure of experience that shapes how the investor perceives and interprets the present.\nAI systems, in contrast, can process historical data and make statistical projections, but they lack this unified temporal structure. Their “knowledge” of the past consists of statistical patterns extracted from training data, not lived experience. Their projections of the future derive from these same patterns, not from a meaningful engagement with possibilities that matter to them. This difference becomes particularly evident in novel situations that diverge significantly from historical patterns—precisely the situations where human judgment proves most valuable.",

    "text": "4.4 The Social Dimension of Intelligence\nAnother crucial aspect of human intelligence emerges from what Heidegger calls “being-with” (Mitsein)—our fundamental connectedness with other humans in a shared world of meaning. Human intelligence develops through social interaction, cultural inheritance, and participation in what philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer later called “traditions of understanding.”\nConsider how a seasoned executive can “read the room” during a complex negotiation. This capacity isn’t merely about processing verbal statements and visual cues; it draws on a lifetime of social and cultural understanding that allows the executive to sense tensions, identify shared interests, and navigate complex human dynamics. This social intelligence emerges from our participation in a shared world of meaning that AI systems, despite their sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities, don’t inhabit.\nThis social dimension helps explain why AI systems trained on internet text often reproduce biases, stereotypes, and problematic patterns present in their training data. These systems don’t possess the social understanding that allows humans to critically evaluate cultural norms and practices. They can mimic patterns of language without grasping the ethical and social implications of those patterns.",

    "text": "4.5 The Case for Enhancement Rather Than Replacement\nThese philosophical insights illuminate why enhancement rather than replacement represents the more productive path for AI development. AI systems excel at certain types of information processing—they can analyze vast datasets, identify statistical patterns, and generate outputs that follow those patterns. But they lack the embodied, temporal, and social dimensions of human intelligence that emerge from our being-in-the-world.\nThis suggests that AI should be designed to complement human capabilities rather than replicate them. Think about how a hammer extends human capabilities without attempting to replicate the human arm. Similarly, AI should extend human intelligence without trying to replicate human understanding.\nFor example, see these three different business activities:\nProcessing insurance claims involves following procedures and applying consistent rules to standardized information—an ideal candidate for AI enhancement. The AI can handle the computational complexity while humans provide judgment in unusual cases that require contextual understanding.\nNegotiating a major acquisition requires deep cultural understanding, ethical judgment, and reading subtle human dynamics—activities that emerge from our being-in-the-world in ways that AI cannot replicate. Here, AI might assist with data analysis while humans manage the relational and strategic dimensions.\nDeveloping new product strategy requires what Heidegger calls “projection”—understanding current possibilities in light of future potential. AI can provide data and analysis, but the creative insight that identifies meaningful new directions draws on human capacities for imagination and situated understanding that AI lacks.\nThis pattern appears consistently in markets. Companies that attempt to fully automate complex human judgments often disappoint, while those that use AI to enhance human capabilities tend to succeed. It’s not about making AI more “human-like” but about recognizing the unique characteristics of human intelligence and designing systems that complement rather than replace them.",

The goal of creating machines that think “like humans” assumes that human thinking is essentially computational—precisely the assumption that Heidegger and other Continental philosophers challenge.\nIf human intelligence emerges from our embodied existence, temporal structure, and social embeddedness, then replicating it would require not just more sophisticated algorithms but machines that inhabit the world as we do. This doesn’t mean AGI is impossible in principle, but it suggests that the path toward it may require fundamentally different approaches than the current focus on increasingly sophisticated computational models.\nRather than pursuing artificial general intelligence that replicates human thinking, we might more productively focus on artificial specific intelligence that complements human capabilities—systems designed to handle computational complexity while preserving space for the uniquely human dimensions of judgment, creativity, and meaning-making.",

AI excels at “how” tasks—executing well-defined processes according to explicit rules. Humans maintain advantages in determining “what” is worth doing—making judgments about value, meaning, and purpose that emerge from our being-in-the-world.\nThis connects to what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called “flow”—a state of absorbed engagement similar to Heidegger’s “ready-to-hand” mode. When executives describe being “in the zone” or “in the flow,” they’re experiencing a mode of understanding that transcends explicit computation. Their decisions emerge from a holistic grasp of the situation rather than step-by-step calculation.\nInterestingly, this flow state often accompanies our most effective performance while being least amenable to computational modeling. The jazz musician improvising a solo, the CEO navigating a complex strategic decision, and the physician making a difficult diagnosis all draw on forms of understanding that emerge from embodied expertise rather than explicit algorithms.",

By recognizing that human intelligence emerges from our embodied, temporal, and social existence—not just from computational processing—we can develop more realistic expectations about AI’s potential and limitations.\nThis doesn’t diminish AI’s transformative potential. Just as technologies from writing to calculators have extended human capabilities without replacing human intelligence, AI can enhance our cognitive capabilities in ways that complement rather than replicate our distinctively human ways of understanding the world.\nThe future belongs not to artificial general intelligence that mimics human thinking, but to human-AI partnerships that respect and amplify what makes human intelligence unique—our being-in-the-world, our temporality, and our fundamental way of sharing meaning with others. This perspective guides both our technical approach to AI implementation and our philosophical understanding of what it means to be human in an increasingly technological world.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "5.1 The Uniqueness of Human Judgment\nIn an era increasingly defined by algorithmic processing, the question of human judgment’s unique value becomes not merely philosophical but practical. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has created a peculiar paradox: as machines become more capable of executing sophisticated tasks, the most distinctly human capacities become more valuable, not less. To understand this paradox requires careful examination of what constitutes judgment and why it remains stubbornly resistant to computational replication.\nRecall the ambitious attempt to create Beethoven’s unfinished tenth symphony using artificial intelligence. The project, undertaken by Playform AI, represented a perfect test case for understanding the boundaries between algorithmic production and human creation. The team trained sophisticated models on Beethoven’s complete works, incorporating fragments and sketches the composer had left for his tenth symphony. The result was technically proficient—notes arranged in patterns statistically consistent with Beethoven’s compositional style. Yet something essential was missing.\nMusic critic Jan Swafford’s assessment was unequivocal: “aimless and uninspired.” What Swafford identified was not merely technical deficiency but the absence of struggle, refinement, and contextual understanding that characterized Beethoven’s actual creative process. The composer’s drafts were often mundane until transformed through iterative revision guided by judgment—a quality that emerges from being situated in a cultural, historical, and emotional context that no algorithm, however sophisticated, currently inhabits.\nThis observation extends beyond music. Across domains—from sports to business leadership, from medical diagnosis to strategic planning—we find consistent evidence that human judgment operates differently from algorithmic processing. The difference lies not merely in computational capacity but in the nature of understanding itself.\nAs discussed in chapter four, Martin Heidegger’s philosophical framework provides valuable insight here. Heidegger challenged the Cartesian notion that human intelligence is primarily computational, arguing instead that our fundamental relationship with the world is one of “being-in-the-world” (Dasein). From this perspective, understanding emerges not from abstract calculation but from practical engagement with a meaningful context. Humans do not process the world as detached observers calculating optimal responses; rather, we inhabit it as participants whose very perception is structured by practical concerns and possibilities.\nWhen we navigate complex situations—whether negotiating a business deal, diagnosing an unusual medical condition, or responding to unexpected market shifts—we draw upon this embodied understanding. We recognize patterns not as statistical correlations but as meaningful constellations of relevance. This capacity for situated judgment represents what philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, interpreting Heidegger, called “comportment”—an orientation toward the world that precedes and enables explicit reasoning.\nArtificial intelligence systems, while increasingly sophisticated in their pattern recognition capabilities, operate fundamentally differently. They recognize statistical regularities without inhabiting the human world of concerns and commitments. This distinction becomes apparent when examining the architecture of both human and algorithmic judgment.",

    "section": "5.2 The Architecture of Judgment",
    "text": "5.2 The Architecture of Judgment\nHuman judgment integrates multiple dimensions of understanding that current AI systems struggle to replicate. Large language models (LLMs) represent state-of-the-art capabilities in natural language processing. These systems excel at pattern recognition and statistical inference but encounter fundamental limitations when faced with tasks requiring genuine understanding.\nThe inability of LLMs to “backtrack”—to revise fundamental assumptions mid-stream—represents more than a technical limitation. It reveals a structural difference between statistical pattern completion and genuine understanding. When humans engage in complex reasoning, we constantly revise our approach based on emerging information, testing alternative frames of reference and adjusting our conceptual foundations. This capacity for recursive self-correction reflects our temporality—our ability to hold past, present, and future in dynamic tension.\nFor example, when confronted with the task of writing “a sentence that describes its own length in words,” LLMs consistently fail despite their impressive capabilities. The task requires not merely statistical inference but meta-cognitive awareness—the ability to simultaneously generate content while monitoring and adjusting that content against an evolving standard. This capacity for self-reference and dynamic adjustment characterizes human judgment across domains.\nEqually significant is what philosopher Michael Polanyi termed “tacit knowledge”—understanding that cannot be fully articulated in explicit terms. Expert clinicians recognize patterns of disease before they can articulate the specific indicators that triggered their concern. Experienced investors sense market shifts through subtle cues that precede formal indicators. This dimension of understanding emerges from embodied experience accumulated over years of immersion in particular contexts.\nThe distinction parallels what we call the “what-how” divide in contemporary knowledge work. Artificial intelligence excels at executing “how” tasks—implementing specific procedures once objectives have been defined. The increasing capability of AI systems to execute these procedural tasks generates enormous efficiency gains across industries. Yet these gains simultaneously increase the premium on “what” intelligence—the capacity to determine meaningful objectives, frame problems effectively, and identify relevant contexts for analysis.",

    "text": "5.3 The “What-How” Divide in Professional Contexts\nFinancial markets provide a particularly instructive domain for examining this distinction. Quantitative models have transformed investment management, enabling sophisticated analysis of vast datasets and revealing patterns invisible to unaided human perception. Yet the most successful investment approaches typically integrate algorithmic analysis with human judgment rather than replacing the latter with the former.\nThis integration recognizes that market behavior reflects not merely mathematical relationships but complex human psychology, institutional dynamics, and contextual factors that resist complete formalization. Both the 1998 collapse of Long Term Capital and the 2008 financial crisis illustrated the dangers of excessive reliance on quantitative models that failed to account for human behavior under exceptional conditions. Similarly, the unprecedented monetary interventions following the COVID-19 pandemic created market conditions that defied historical patterns, requiring judgment to navigate effectively.\nThe most sophisticated hedge funds and investment firms have therefore developed what might be termed “judgment architectures”—organizational structures that integrate algorithmic processing with human expertise. These architectures recognize that algorithms excel at processing vast datasets and identifying statistical patterns, while human judgment excels at integrating these patterns with broader contextual understanding and adapting to novel situations. Investment firms that were successful navigating the 1998 and 2008 crises recognized that human intervention was indispensable to handle unique situations. Yet it is those situations that differentiate an outstanding investor from one who is merely competent.\nSimilar patterns emerge in technical implementation across industries.Think for example of the arduous development of fully autonomous vehicles, easily one of the most ambitious applications of artificial intelligence to real-world problems. Despite massive investments and impressive technical achievements, full autonomy remains elusive in complex, unpredictable environments. Today, autonomous vehicle can manage trips that are relatively easy and uneventful, say an orderly turn on a quiet road or an exit from a highway, but they still struggle and are accident-prone when an expected situation emerges, say if a pedestrian suddenly emerges in the car’s path.\nThe challenges facing autonomous vehicle systems reveal the limitations of purely algorithmic approaches to navigation and decision-making. While these systems excel at processing sensor data and executing well-defined maneuvers, they struggle with the contextual understanding that human drivers develop through embodied experience. A human driver intuitively recognizes that children playing near a street require extra caution, that an unusually positioned vehicle might indicate an unseen hazard, or that specific weather conditions might affect road surfaces in ways not immediately visible.\nRodney Brooks, robotics pioneer and former director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, has consistently emphasized these limitations. His predictions regarding autonomous vehicle development have proven remarkably accurate, with full autonomy consistently arriving later than industry projections. Brooks understands that navigating physical environments requires not merely sophisticated sensors and algorithms but contextual understanding that emerges from being situated in a meaningful world.",

    "section": "5.4 Decision-Making Under Uncertainty",
    "text": "5.4 Decision-Making Under Uncertainty\nPerhaps the most significant advantage of human judgment becomes apparent under conditions of genuine uncertainty. Algorithmic approaches excel at optimizing decisions under risk—situations where potential outcomes and their probabilities can be reasonably estimated. They struggle, however, with uncertainty—situations involving unknown variables, emergent phenomena, and fundamental indeterminacy.\nThis distinction becomes particularly relevant in domains characterized by complexity, path dependency, and human interaction. In planning a pandemic response for example, initial frameworks must adapt to evolving viral behavior, social dynamics, and institutional constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed both the value of algorithmic modeling and its limitations when confronting genuinely novel situations. The most effective responses integrated computational modeling with expert judgment that could adapt to emerging information and contextual factors.\nThe limitations of purely algorithmic approaches under uncertainty relate to a “paradox of explicability.” Organizations increasingly demand explainable AI—systems whose recommendations can be traced to transparent reasoning processes. Yet humans routinely trust human experts whose intuitive judgments cannot be fully articulated and that may appear opaque to a layperson. We accept that an experienced physician’s concern might precede explicit justification or that a seasoned investor’s caution might reflect pattern recognition too subtle for immediate expression.\nThis asymmetric standard constitutes the ultimate “human edge” and it reflects an implicit understanding that human judgment operates differently from algorithmic processing. We recognize that human experts integrate explicit knowledge with tacit understanding developed through situated experience. This integration enables what philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce termed “abduction”—the generation of novel hypotheses that cannot be derived through purely deductive or inductive reasoning.\nThe capacity for abductive reasoning becomes particularly valuable when confronting black swan events—high-impact developments that lie outside normal expectations and resist prediction through historical analysis. The financial market disruptions following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic each required judgment that could transcend historical patterns and recognize emergent possibilities.",

    "section": "5.5 The Enhancement Framework Revisited",
    "text": "5.5 The Enhancement Framework Revisited\nUnderstanding these distinctive capacities allows us to develop more effective approaches to human-AI collaboration. Rather than conceptualizing artificial intelligence as a replacement for human judgment, we can design systems that enhance human capabilities by performing complementary functions. This enhancement framework acknowledges the distinctive strengths of both human judgment and algorithmic processing. Simply put, AI can enhance, accelerate and facilitate a lot of work, but it cannot perform at the same standard of excellence of top human experts.\nEffective enhancement requires careful attention to interface design, workflow integration, and organizational architecture. Systems that increase cognitive load or interrupt natural decision processes can impair rather than enhance judgment. Conversely, well-designed systems can augment human capabilities by performing computational tasks that would otherwise consume attention, presenting relevant information at appropriate moments, and identifying patterns that might escape notice.\nPalantir Technologies offers an instructive example of this approach. The company’s data integration platforms serve intelligence agencies, financial institutions, and healthcare organizations by augmenting rather than replacing analyst judgment. These systems enable human analysts to navigate vast datasets efficiently, identify relevant patterns, and develop insights that inform strategic decisions. The resulting “intelligence augmentation” preserves human judgment while enhancing the informational context within which that judgment operates.\nSimilar principles apply across domains. In healthcare, diagnostic support systems have proven most effective when designed to augment rather than replace physician judgment. These systems can identify potential conditions based on symptom patterns, suggest relevant tests, and provide reference information while preserving the physician’s capacity to integrate these inputs with clinical observation and patient context.\nMaintaining this balance requires organizational cultures and training protocols that preserve “judgment muscles” rather than allowing atrophy through excessive automation. Just as physical skills deteriorate without practice, judgment capacities require regular exercise to maintain effectiveness. Organizations that excessively automate routine decisions may inadvertently undermine the expertise development that enables effective judgment in non-routine situations.",

    "text": "5.6 The Philosophical Stakes\nThe distinction between enhancement and replacement frameworks reflects deeper philosophical questions about authenticity and agency in an algorithmic age. As artificial intelligence systems generate increasingly sophisticated outputs—from business analyses to creative content—we confront questions about the value of human contribution and the nature of meaningful work.\nConsider the emerging phenomenon of AI-generated content that appears “too perfect” in its technical execution while lacking the distinctive voice that characterizes human expression. This perfection paradoxically signals inauthenticity—an absence of the individual perspective and situated understanding that give human communication its distinctive character. We value human content not despite but partially because of its imperfections, which signal authentic engagement with the messiness of lived experience. In some fields, we could say that the human is great because he/she is imperfect, and not robotic.\nThis observation connects to Heidegger’s critique of technology as potentially obscuring authentic human engagement with the world. The danger lies not in technological advancement itself but in frameworks that position technology as a replacement for rather than an enhancement of distinctively human capacities. When we conceptualize artificial intelligence primarily as a substitute for human judgment, we risk undermining the very qualities that give work meaning and enable effective navigation of complex environments.\nContemporary philosophical approaches, including extended cognition and enactivist theories of mind, offer valuable resources for reconciling technological enhancement with authentic human agency. These frameworks recognize that human cognition has always been extended through tools—from writing implements to computational devices—without thereby becoming less authentically human. The question becomes not whether to integrate algorithmic processing into human work but how to do so in ways that preserve and enhance rather than diminish human judgment.",

    "text": "5.7 Investment Implications\nThese philosophical considerations have practical implications for investment strategy in an age of advancing artificial intelligence. Companies developing AI applications fall broadly into two categories: those pursuing replacement frameworks that aim to automate human judgment, and those pursuing enhancement frameworks that aim to augment human capabilities. The latter category may offer more sustainable competitive advantages and resilient business models.\nSeveral factors favor enhancement-focused approaches:\n\nRegulatory frameworks increasingly demand human oversight for high-stakes decisions, creating persistent demand for human-in-the-loop systems in healthcare, financial services, and other regulated industries.\nEnhancement approaches align with organizational preferences for incremental transformation rather than disruptive replacement, facilitating adoption and integration.\nEnhancement frameworks leverage existing human expertise while improving efficiency, creating immediate value rather than requiring complete transformation of workflows.\nThe limitations of purely algorithmic approaches to complex, uncertain environments create persistent demand for human judgment in strategic roles.\n\nThese factors suggest that the most durable competitive advantages may emerge from technologies that enhance rather than replace human judgment, and from the addition of human inputs to these technologies in ways that yield greater results. Vector databases represent one such technology, enabling more effective knowledge management by organizing information according to conceptual relevance rather than merely textual similarity. These systems enhance human capabilities by making relevant information more accessible without attempting to replace the judgment that determines how that information should be applied.\nSimilar opportunities exist across sectors. Healthcare technologies that enhance physician capabilities while preserving clinical judgment may prove more sustainable than those pursuing full automation of diagnostic processes. Financial technologies that augment analyst capabilities while preserving strategic judgment may outperform those attempting to replace human decision-making entirely. Educational technologies that enhance teacher effectiveness while preserving pedagogical judgment may demonstrate greater durability than those positioning technology as a replacement for human instruction.",

    "text": "5.8 Judgment as Competitive Advantage\nThe paradox of advancing artificial intelligence is that it simultaneously commoditizes certain skills while increasing the premium on distinctively human judgment. As procedural tasks become increasingly automated, the capacity to frame problems effectively, identify relevant contexts, and navigate uncertainty becomes more valuable, not less. This pattern suggests that developing judgment capacity—both individual and organizational—represents a sustainable competitive advantage in an algorithmic age.\nThe enhancement framework provides a guide for navigating this transformation effectively. By conceptualizing artificial intelligence as augmenting rather than replacing human judgment, organizations can leverage technological capabilities while preserving the distinctive capacities that enable effective navigation of complex, uncertain environments. This approach recognizes that the most valuable form of intelligence emerges not from either human or algorithmic processing in isolation but from their thoughtful integration.\nThe future belongs not to those who seek to replicate human judgment but to those who enhance it—preserving the human element in an increasingly algorithmic world.

    "text": "6.1 The Enhancement Zone\nA friend who runs customer support at a Fortune 500 consumer products company recently faced a dilemma. Her team had been assigned to evaluate Microsoft’s CoPilot, an AI assistant meant to boost productivity. After weeks of testing, she discovered something surprising: while the AI could compose email replies and generate meeting summaries, employees were spending as much time editing the AI’s output as they would have spent writing from scratch. The AI’s responses, though grammatically perfect, lacked the human touch that customers expect.\nMeanwhile, a senior cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic told us about her first experience with an AI diagnostic system. The AI flagged a subtle pattern in an echocardiogram that she had initially missed—a potential early sign of valve dysfunction that wouldn’t have been caught during routine analysis. Yet in the same week, the AI confidently misinterpreted another scan, suggesting a serious condition where none existed. The cardiologist’s contextual understanding and clinical experience immediately recognized the error.\nThese stories encapsulate what we’ve observed repeatedly across industries: AI and human intelligence each have distinct strengths and limitations. The most powerful implementations arise not when one replaces the other, but when they work in concert. This chapter explores how to identify and develop these optimal collaboration points—the “enhancement sweet spot.”\nFor most of AI’s history, the underlying assumption has been replacement: could machines match or exceed human performance at specific tasks? This framing misses the more nuanced reality emerging across successful implementations. The question isn’t whether AI can replace humans, but how AI and humans can complement each other in the “enhancement zone.”\nA good illustration comes from how pilots interact with modern aircraft systems. The autopilot handles routine flight operations, allowing human pilots to focus on higher-level decisions and emergency responses. This division of labor exemplifies the enhancement zone – where AI handles detail-oriented tasks while humans manage strategic decisions. The pilot doesn’t need to know exactly how the autopilot calculates minor course corrections. Instead, they focus on what matters: safely getting passengers to their destination.\nA similar dynamic plays out in investment management. Quantitative hedge funds have deployed increasingly sophisticated AI systems to identify market patterns and execute trades at speeds no human could match. But the most successful firms pair these systems with human portfolio managers who bring contextual understanding about macroeconomic trends, geopolitical developments, and regulatory changes that exist outside the AI’s training data.\nDuring the market volatility of March 2020, purely algorithmic trading systems struggled to adapt to unprecedented conditions, while hybrid approaches that combined algorithmic speed with human judgment navigated the turbulence more successfully. Neither approach alone delivered what both accomplished together. Renaissance Technologies runs what are arguably the most advanced algorithmic quant funds in the world. But some of its funds struggled and lost money in 2020 because of extreme volatility during the first year of the pandemic. It is possible that greater human involvement would have limited or avoided these losses.\nThis pattern repeats across domains. In healthcare, AI excels at processing thousands of images with consistent attention to detail that surpasses human capability, but physicians contribute essential contextual understanding of patient history and presentation. In manufacturing, predictive maintenance algorithms can identify potential equipment failures before they occur, but skilled technicians bring valuable context about specific machines and operating conditions.",

    "section": "6.2 The Enhancement Framework",
    "text": "6.2 The Enhancement Framework\nHow do we identify the points where AI can most effectively enhance human capabilities? We’ve developed a practical framework based on our extensive analysis of AI implementations across industries.\n1. The “What” versus “How” Distinction\nAs we explored in Chapter 3, a useful lens for understanding AI’s impact is the distinction between knowing “what” to do versus knowing “how” to do it. This framework helps identify enhancement opportunities by clarifying where each type of intelligence holds comparative advantage.\nAI increasingly masters the “how”—the execution of well-defined processes with clear rules and abundant data. Humans maintain advantages in determining the “what”—the purpose, strategy, and judgment about which processes should be executed and why.\nLook at financial advising. Modern AI systems can execute portfolio optimization, tax-loss harvesting, and rebalancing with greater precision than human advisors (the “how”). But determining a client’s true risk tolerance, understanding their non-financial priorities, and communicating complex trade-offs remains uniquely human territory (the “what”).\nSimilarly, in software development, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer excel at generating code snippets based on patterns they’ve observed in millions of repositories. They handle the “how” of implementation once a developer defines “what” needs to be built. The developer still provides the architectural vision, determines business requirements, and evaluates whether the generated code actually solves the intended problem.\nThis distinction helps identify processes ripe for enhancement. Examine your value chain and ask: Where are we spending significant human resources on “how” tasks that could be handled by AI, potentially freeing human capacity for higher-value “what” activities?\n2. The Decisioning Framework and Four-Quadrant Enhancement Model\nThrough our research across industries, we’ve identified three key questions that help organizations find their enhancement sweet spot:\n\nWhat decisions require contextual understanding that AI cannot replicate?\nWhere can AI’s pattern recognition complement human insight?\nHow can workflow be restructured to leverage both human and AI strengths?\n\nThe answers vary by industry, but the framework remains consistent. At a leading radiology practice we studied, AI excels at flagging potential anomalies in medical images, but radiologists remain essential for interpreting these findings in the context of patient history and symptoms. The AI handles the “how” of image processing, while doctors focus on “what” the findings mean for patient care.\nTo further systematize this approach, we’ve developed a quadrant model that maps activities based on their AI and human value contributions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1\n\n\n\nQuadrant 1: High AI Value, Low Human Value\nThese are tasks where AI consistently outperforms humans, and human involvement adds little value. Examples include monitoring large-scale systems for anomalies, repetitive document processing, and routine calculations across large datasets. These activities are candidates for automation rather than enhancement.\nQuadrant 2: Low AI Value, High Human Value\nThese activities depend on qualities AI fundamentally lacks: empathy, ethical judgment, creative vision, or contextual understanding that transcends available data. Leadership, trust-building, innovative ideation, and complex negotiations fall here. These should remain primarily human domains.\nQuadrant 3: Low AI Value, Low Human Value\nThese tasks benefit neither from human nor AI capabilities alone. They typically represent vestigial processes that could be eliminated entirely or fundamentally redesigned. Many regulatory compliance activities and administrative processes fall into this category.\nQuadrant 4: High AI Value, High Human Value\nThis is the enhancement sweet spot. Both AI and humans bring valuable and complementary capabilities to these tasks. Medical diagnostics, investment research, product design, and strategic decision-making with significant data components all reside here. These activities benefit most from thoughtful human-AI collaboration.\nOrganizations should systematically inventory their processes and map them to these quadrants, prioritizing enhancement initiatives in Quadrant 4 while pursuing automation in Quadrant 1 and process redesign in Quadrant 3.",

    "section": "6.3 Real-World Enhancement Sweet Spots",
    "text": "6.3 Real-World Enhancement Sweet Spots\nLet’s examine how leading organizations across industries have identified and developed their enhancement sweet spots.\nHealthcare: Augmented Diagnostics\nContrary to early predictions that AI would replace radiologists, the most successful implementations enhance radiologists’ capabilities rather than attempting to substitute for them. Mayo Clinic’s work with AI diagnostic tools demonstrates this approach.\nTheir AI systems process medical images to identify potential abnormalities, ranking findings by confidence level rather than making binary judgments. Radiologists then apply their clinical expertise to these machine-flagged areas, bringing contextual understanding of the patient’s history and presentation that the AI lacks.\nThis collaborative approach improves diagnostic accuracy while reducing radiologist fatigue from screening thousands of normal images. It allows radiologists to focus their specialized expertise where it adds most value—on ambiguous cases and integrating findings with broader clinical contexts.\nImportantly, Mayo didn’t simply deploy AI and expect radiologists to adapt. They carefully redesigned workflows to optimize the human-AI partnership, creating intuitive interfaces that present AI findings without overwhelming human users with unnecessary technical details.\nFinancial Services: Enhanced Risk Assessment\nJPMorgan’s implementation of Contract Intelligence (COiN) shows how AI can enhance rather than replace human judgment in financial services. The system reviews legal documents in seconds rather than the 360,000 hours it would take humans, extracting key provisions and flagging potential issues.\nBut final decisions still rest with experienced bankers who understand client relationships, market contexts, and strategic priorities. The AI handles the computational complexity of processing thousands of documents, while humans provide judgment about how to respond to the extracted information.\nThis enhancement approach delivers substantially greater value than either automation or traditional manual processes alone. It reduces costs and processing time while improving accuracy and consistency. Perhaps most importantly, it redirects highly-compensated professionals from low-value document review to high-value client service and strategic thinking.\nManufacturing and Transportation: Enhanced Human Capabilities\nBMW’s implementation of AI in manufacturing quality control demonstrates another successful enhancement approach. Their AI systems analyze images from cameras positioned throughout the production line, identifying potential defects with greater consistency than human inspectors could achieve alone.\nRather than replacing quality inspectors, the system flags potential issues for human review. Experienced inspectors bring contextual understanding about which deviations matter and which don’t—knowledge that would be difficult to fully encode in an AI system.\nThis collaborative approach has reduced defect rates while allowing human inspectors to focus on complex quality issues rather than routine visual scanning. It combines AI’s consistency and tirelessness with human judgment about what constitutes acceptable quality in different contexts.\nA similar philosophy guides Daimler Trucks’ approach to AI. Rather than pursuing full autonomy at all costs, they developed AI systems that help human drivers operate more safely and efficiently. The AI handles tasks like maintaining safe following distances and optimizing fuel consumption, while humans manage complex navigation and unexpected situations. This stands in stark contrast to some autonomous vehicle companies that have struggled by trying to eliminate human drivers entirely.\nCreative Industries: Collaborative Design\nWhile early AI art generators prompted fears about machines replacing creative professionals, the enhancement approach is proving more valuable. Design firm IDEO’s work with generative AI tools shows how this plays out in practice.\nTheir designers use AI systems to rapidly generate design variations based on initial parameters. The AI handles the computational aspects of design exploration, producing dozens of options that would take humans significantly longer to create manually.\nHuman designers then apply their aesthetic judgment, client understanding, and cultural context to select, modify, and refine these machine-generated options. The result combines AI’s ability to explore a wide design space with human designers’ judgment about which options meet client needs and resonate with target audiences.\nAdobe has taken a similar approach with their AI features. Rather than replacing designers, their tools handle tedious tasks like image resizing and background removal, freeing humans to focus on creative direction and client needs. Attempts to fully automate creative work often disappoint, while approaches that enhance human creativity succeed.\nThis enhancement approach accelerates the design process while maintaining the essential human judgment that clients value. It allows designers to explore more options in less time without sacrificing the creative direction that distinguishes professional design from mere iteration.",

    "section": "6.4 Implementation Principles for Finding Your Sweet Spot",
    "text": "6.4 Implementation Principles for Finding Your Sweet Spot\nOrganizations that successfully enhance human capabilities with AI follow several key principles:\nThe Role of Management and Cultural Considerations\nFinding the sweet spot requires rethinking traditional management approaches. Leaders must understand both AI’s capabilities and human psychology. When McKinsey implemented AI tools for its consultants, success came not from the technology itself but from careful attention to how consultants would interact with it. The firm recognized that consultants needed to maintain ownership of client relationships and strategic insights while leveraging AI for research and analysis.\nThis highlights a crucial point: the enhancement sweet spot isn’t static. As AI capabilities evolve, the boundary between human and machine tasks shifts. Organizations need adaptive frameworks that allow for continuous rebalancing of responsibilities.\nPerhaps most importantly, organizations must maintain “human centrality” – the principle that AI serves human objectives rather than the reverse. This requires careful attention to organizational culture. When Microsoft deployed AI tools across its engineering teams, success came from emphasizing how the technology would enhance rather than replace human capabilities.\nStart with Human Needs, Not AI Capabilities\nMany AI implementations fail because they begin with the technology rather than the problem. Organizations acquire AI solutions looking for applications, rather than identifying specific human capabilities they want to enhance.\nSuccessful implementers reverse this approach. They start by asking: “What human capabilities would we most like to enhance?” This human-centered perspective leads to more valuable applications than a technology-driven implementation.\nSee for example how Stitch Fix approached AI implementation. Rather than simply automating their stylists out of existence, they identified specific aspects of the styling process where humans struggled with computational complexity—managing thousands of inventory items across multiple dimensions like size, color, style, and fabric. They then developed AI tools that handled this complexity while preserving human judgment about what would delight each specific customer.\nThis approach enhanced the capabilities of their human stylists rather than replacing them. The result was more personalized recommendations than either humans or algorithms could achieve alone.\nDesign for Appropriate Division of Labor\nThe interface between human and AI should leverage the strengths of each. AI can process vast datasets and identify patterns, while humans excel at contextual understanding and judgment. Design interactions that optimize this complementarity.\nGoldman Sachs’ implementation of AI in investment research exemplifies this principle. Their systems analyze earnings transcripts, news reports, and market data at scales no human analyst could match. But rather than generating automated investment recommendations, the systems identify patterns and anomalies for human analysts to investigate.\nThis division of labor plays to the strengths of each: AI handles data processing at scale, while human analysts contribute contextual understanding about market psychology, regulatory environments, and competitive dynamics that may not be fully captured in the data.\nBuild Trust Through Appropriate Transparency\nUsers need appropriate visibility into how AI systems reach their conclusions. The degree of transparency should match the stakes of the decisions being supported—higher-stakes applications require greater transparency and explainability.\nMicrosoft’s implementation of AI-powered features in their development tools illustrates this principle. When their Copilot system suggests code, it provides context about where similar patterns have been used before and the reasoning behind its suggestions. This transparency helps developers maintain appropriate skepticism about AI recommendations while leveraging its capabilities.\nBy contrast, some early medical AI systems operated as “black boxes,” providing diagnoses without explanation. This approach undermined physician trust and limited adoption, regardless of technical accuracy. Newer systems provide visualization of the patterns they’ve identified and the reasoning behind their assessments, enabling appropriate human oversight.\nEvolve Through Iteration\nThe enhancement sweet spot shifts as both AI capabilities and human practices evolve. Successful implementations establish feedback mechanisms to continuously refine the human-AI partnership based on real-world performance.\nNetflix’s recommendation system exemplifies this principle. Rather than deploying a static algorithm, they continuously evaluate how users interact with recommendations and refine their approach. This iterative process has led to increasingly nuanced collaboration between algorithmic recommendations and human content creators.\nSimilarly, Google’s implementation of AI in search has evolved through continuous refinement based on user interactions. The current system represents years of iterative development to find the optimal balance between algorithmic processing and human oversight.",

    "section": "6.5 Finding Your Organization’s Sweet Spot",
    "text": "6.5 Finding Your Organization’s Sweet Spot\nHow can you identify and develop enhancement opportunities in your own organization? We recommend a systematic approach:\n1. Process Inventory and Mapping\nBegin by inventorying key processes across your organization. For each process, evaluate:\n\nCurrent performance metrics and pain points\nThe nature of human contribution (judgment, creativity, empathy, etc.)\nData availability and quality\nPotential value of enhancement\n\nMap these processes to the four-quadrant model described earlier, prioritizing those in the high AI value/high human value quadrant for enhancement initiatives.\nSuccessful implementations require several key elements:\n\nClear role definition: Both humans and AI need well-defined responsibilities that play to their strengths. At Goldman Sachs, AI handles data analysis and pattern recognition in trading, while human traders focus on strategy and risk assessment.\nFeedback loops: Humans must be able to override and correct AI when necessary. This isn’t just about catching errors – it’s about maintaining human agency and improving the system over time.\nTraining and adaptation: Workers need support in developing new skills that complement AI capabilities. The goal isn’t to compete with AI but to leverage it effectively.\n\n2. Pilot Selection and Design\nSelect 1-3 high-potential processes for initial enhancement pilots. For each pilot:\n\nDefine clear success metrics that capture both efficiency and effectiveness\nDesign for appropriate division of labor between human and AI\nEstablish feedback mechanisms to capture user experience and suggestions\nPlan for iteration based on early results\n\nResist the temptation to tackle too many processes simultaneously. Enhancement requires careful design of the human-AI interaction, which benefits from focused attention and learning from early implementations.\n3. Capability Building\nSuccessful enhancement requires new capabilities across the organization:\n\nTechnical teams need skills in human-centered design, not just AI development\nDomain experts need understanding of AI capabilities and limitations\nLeadership needs frameworks for evaluating enhancement opportunities\nEveryone needs appropriate mental models for human-AI collaboration\n\nInvest in building these capabilities alongside technical implementation. Organizations that treat enhancement as purely a technical challenge typically achieve lower returns than those that invest in broader organizational capability building.\n4. Scaling and Evolution\nAs pilots demonstrate value, develop plans for scaling successful approaches while continuing to refine the human-AI interaction:\n\nEstablish governance mechanisms to ensure consistent implementation while allowing for domain-specific adaptation\nBuild feedback loops to capture learning and identify improvement opportunities\nMonitor for unintended consequences and adaptation needs\nContinuously reassess the optimal division of labor as capabilities evolve",

    "text": "6.6 Beyond Optimization: The Strategic Implications of Enhancement\nFinding your enhancement sweet spot delivers operational benefits through improved efficiency and effectiveness. But the strategic implications go further. Organizations that successfully enhance human capabilities with AI gain several sustainable advantages:\nTalent Attraction and Retention\nAs AI automates routine tasks, knowledge workers increasingly seek roles that emphasize uniquely human capabilities like creativity, judgment, and empathy. Organizations that design for enhancement rather than replacement create more attractive roles that leverage these capabilities.\nThe Mayo Clinic’s approach to AI in radiology has made them more attractive to top talent, not less. By enhancing radiologists’ capabilities rather than attempting to replace them, they’ve created roles that emphasize the aspects of the profession that attracted physicians to the field in the first place—using clinical judgment to improve patient outcomes.\nSustainable Competitive Advantage\nEnhancement approaches often create advantages that are harder for competitors to replicate than pure automation. While algorithms can be copied, the integration of AI capabilities with organization-specific human expertise creates unique combinations that are difficult to imitate.\nJPMorgan’s Contract Intelligence system delivers value not just through its technical capabilities, but through its integration with the firm’s specific workflows, domain expertise, and client relationships. This integrated approach creates a more sustainable advantage than either technical capabilities or human expertise alone.\nSystem Resilience\nEnhancement approaches typically create more resilient systems than pure automation. By maintaining appropriate human oversight and judgment, these systems can better handle edge cases, adapt to changing conditions, and recover from failures.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations that had pursued enhancement rather than replacement generally adapted more successfully to unprecedented conditions. Their human-AI systems could incorporate new information and adapt to changing circumstances more effectively than fully automated approaches.\nLooking Forward: The Human-Centered Future of AI\nAs AI capabilities continue to advance, finding the enhancement sweet spot becomes increasingly crucial. Organizations that succeed will be those that maintain focus on human judgment while leveraging AI’s computational power. This isn’t just about efficiency – it’s about creating sustainable competitive advantage through superior decision-making.\nRecall the evolution of chess after Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. Rather than eliminating human players, AI led to the emergence of centaur chess, where human-AI teams consistently outperform either humans or AI alone. This model points to the future of knowledge work: not a competition between human and artificial intelligence, but a synthesis that enhances human capabilities while preserving human agency.\nThe most valuable AI implementations of the coming decade will neither attempt to replicate human capabilities nor eliminate human roles. Instead, they will enhance human judgment, creativity, and decision-making by handling computational complexity while preserving space for uniquely human contributions.\nFinding your enhancement sweet spot requires systematic evaluation of where human and artificial intelligence can most effectively complement each other. By applying the frameworks and principles outlined in this chapter, organizations can move beyond simplistic automation narratives toward more sophisticated enhancement strategies that create sustainable value.\nAs Heidegger might suggest, the essence of technology is nothing technological. The true value of AI lies not in its technical capabilities alone, but in how those capabilities enhance human potential. Organizations that understand this fundamental truth will lead the next wave of innovation—not by developing the most advanced AI systems, but by most effectively integrating AI with human capabilities.\nWe expect to see continued evolution in how humans and AI interact. The enhancement sweet spot will shift as AI capabilities advance, but the fundamental principle remains: successful implementation requires keeping humans central to decision-making while leveraging AI’s unique capabilities.\nWe return to our Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who summarized it perfectly: “The AI doesn’t replace my judgment—it extends my capabilities. I can see patterns I might have missed while still applying the contextual understanding that comes from years of clinical experience. Together, we’re better than either of us alone.”\nThat’s the enhancement sweet spot—and finding yours is the key to successful AI implementation.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "7.1 The Enhancement Framework in Practice\nThe gap between artificial intelligence’s theoretical potential and its practical implementation remains stubbornly wide. Most organizations approach AI implementation backward, starting with the technology rather than the human element. They ask “What can AI do?” instead of “How can we enhance our people’s capabilities?” This fundamental mistake leads to costly failures and missed opportunities.\nRecall the Fortune 500 consumer products company we mentioned in Chapter 6. Their project team, tasked with finding AI-driven productivity gains from Microsoft’s CoPilot suite, discovered that while the technology could indeed compose email replies and summarize meetings, users spent as much time editing the AI’s output as they would have spent writing from scratch. The AI was attempting to replace rather than enhance human capabilities.\nThis pattern repeats across industries. Companies implement AI solutions looking for quick automation wins, only to discover that the technology works best when designed to augment human judgment rather than replace it. The key to successful implementation lies in understanding the distinct roles of human and artificial intelligence, then building systems that leverage the strengths of both.\nAs we explored in Chapter 3, a clear framework for distinguishing between tasks suitable for automation versus those that require human enhancement is essential. This distinction often maps to what we have described as the “what versus how” paradigm.\nAI excels at executing the “how” - processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and generating outputs based on learned patterns. Humans excel at determining “what” needs to be done, providing context, and exercising judgment about the appropriateness of AI-generated outputs. This framework helps organizations avoid the common pitfall of trying to automate judgment-heavy tasks better suited for enhancement.\nIn financial services, AI can process market data and generate trading signals at superhuman speed (the “how”), but successful firms keep humans in charge of setting strategy and risk parameters (the “what”). JPMorgan’s implementation of AI in its trading operations demonstrates this principle. Rather than attempting to fully automate trading decisions, the bank uses AI to enhance traders’ capabilities by surfacing relevant patterns and anomalies while leaving final decisions to human judgment.",

    "text": "7.2 Building Trust Through Transparency\nOne of the biggest implementation challenges is building trust between human users and AI systems. This requires making the AI’s capabilities and limitations transparent to users while establishing clear boundaries for human oversight.\nThe healthcare sector offers instructive examples. Successful implementations of AI in medical diagnosis follow a clear pattern: the AI processes medical images or patient data to flag potential issues (the “how”), but doctors remain responsible for diagnosis and treatment decisions (the “what”). This approach maintains the critical element of human judgment while leveraging AI’s pattern-recognition capabilities.\nCrucially, these systems make their reasoning process visible to doctors. Rather than simply presenting conclusions, they highlight the specific patterns or anomalies that led to their recommendations. This transparency helps build trust and enables doctors to exercise informed judgment about the AI’s suggestions.\nMayo Clinic’s deployment of AI tools in radiology exemplifies this approach. Their systems don’t simply classify images as “normal” or “abnormal.” Instead, they highlight specific areas of potential concern and explain the features that triggered the alert. This gives radiologists both valuable information and critical context, allowing them to exercise professional judgment informed by the AI’s analysis.",

    "text": "7.3 The Training Challenge: Beyond Technical Skills\nImplementing AI successfully requires significant investment in human training, but not in the way most organizations expect. Rather than focusing solely on technical training about how to use AI tools, successful implementations emphasize training in judgment - helping humans understand when and how to rely on AI assistance.\nAeroVironment’s implementation of AI in military applications is a telling case. Operators receive extensive training not just in operating the AI systems but in understanding their limitations and failure modes. This approach produces operators who can effectively collaborate with AI while maintaining the critical human judgment needed for military operations.\nThe most effective training programs go beyond button-pushing instructions to develop a proficiency akin to “AI literacy” - a sophisticated understanding of what AI does well, where it struggles, and how to evaluate its outputs critically. This requires a combination of technical knowledge and domain expertise.\nGoldman Sachs takes this approach with their AI-enhanced investment tools. Analysts learn not just how to use the tools but how to identify situations where the AI’s recommendations might be biased by historical patterns that no longer apply or where additional human judgment is crucial. This balanced approach maintains the human element while leveraging AI’s computational strengths.",

    "text": "7.4 Measuring Success Beyond Efficiency\nTraditional metrics often fail to capture the true value of AI enhancement implementations. Organizations frequently focus on easily measurable efficiency gains while missing the more substantial benefits of enhanced human judgment and decision-making. This approach gives too much weight to all the things that can be measured, and not enough attention to those that cannot be.\nPalantir’s implementations offer a model for better measurement. Rather than focusing solely on automation metrics, they measure success through the quality of human-AI collaboration - tracking how effectively analysts use AI tools to reach better conclusions faster. This approach recognizes that AI’s value lies not in replacing human analysts but in enhancing their capabilities.\nEffective measurement frameworks consider both quantitative improvements (time saved, volume processed) and qualitative outcomes (decision quality, novel insights generated, unexpected connections identified). The latter often represent the true value of enhancement approaches but require more sophisticated measurement approaches.\nA major healthcare system found that its AI-assisted diagnostic system reduced the time radiologists spent reviewing normal scans by 31%, a clear efficiency gain. But the more valuable outcome was a 22% increase in early detection of subtle abnormalities that might otherwise have been missed. This qualitative improvement in diagnostic accuracy represented the true value of the system, though it was harder to measure than simple time savings.",

Organizations often focus on fully automating processes rather than enhancing human capabilities. This leads to resistance from users and missed opportunities for genuine enhancement.\nAnother frequent error is insufficient training in judgment. Most training programs focus on technical operation rather than helping users understand when and how to rely on AI assistance. This leads to either over-reliance on AI recommendations or underutilization of AI capabilities.\nPoor integration with existing workflows represents another significant challenge. AI tools are often implemented as standalone solutions rather than being integrated into existing work processes. This creates friction for users and reduces adoption and effectiveness.\nMany implementations also suffer from a lack of clear boundaries regarding which decisions require human judgment and which can be delegated to AI. Without these guidelines, organizations often drift toward excessive automation, undermining human judgment and creating potential risks.\nFinally, inadequate feedback loops plague many AI implementations. Without effective mechanisms for humans to provide feedback on AI performance and for that feedback to improve the system, AI systems fail to improve over time and users lose confidence in their reliability.",

    "section": "7.6 The Path to Successful Implementation",
    "text": "7.6 The Path to Successful Implementation\nSuccessful AI implementation follows a clear pattern that prioritizes human judgment while leveraging AI’s computational strengths. The process starts with identifying where human judgment adds the most value in your organization. These areas are typically candidates for enhancement rather than automation.\nMcKinsey’s implementation of AI tools for their consulting practice demonstrates this approach. They first mapped how their best consultants synthesized information and formulated recommendations. This revealed that while data analysis could be enhanced by AI, the crucial skills of problem framing and solution crafting relied heavily on human judgment and client relationship understanding.\nDesigning for transparency represents another critical element. AI systems should make their reasoning visible to users, enabling informed human oversight. This goes beyond simple explanations of AI decisions. The system should reveal its confidence levels, data sources, and key factors influencing its recommendations. Users should be able to trace the logic chain from input to output.\nMicrosoft’s implementation of AI coding assistants demonstrates this principle. Rather than simply generating code, the system highlights the patterns and documentation it references, allowing developers to understand and validate its suggestions. This transparency helps developers maintain control while benefiting from AI assistance.\nGradual integration provides another key to success. Beginning with small-scale implementations allows users to build trust and understanding of the AI’s capabilities and limitations. This approach creates opportunities for learning and adjustment without risking major disruption.\nConsider how leading investment firms introduce AI tools to their analysts. They typically begin with using AI for initial data screening and pattern detection, allowing analysts to compare AI insights with their traditional methods. As confidence builds, they gradually expand the AI’s role while maintaining human oversight of investment decisions.\nEstablishing clear boundaries defines explicit guidelines for which decisions require human judgment and which can be delegated to AI. These boundaries should be based on careful analysis of risk, regulatory requirements, and the comparative advantages of human and artificial intelligence.\nJPMorgan’s AI implementation in trading provides an instructive example. They maintain clear rules about which types of trades can be executed automatically versus which require human review. These boundaries consider factors like transaction size, market conditions, and potential impact on other positions. The rules are regularly reviewed and updated based on performance data and changing market conditions.\nBuilding effective feedback loops creates mechanisms for continuous improvement based on human feedback about AI performance. This requires more than simple error reporting. Users should be able to provide context about why certain AI recommendations were helpful or unhelpful, identify emerging edge cases, and suggest improvements to the system’s operation.\nPalantir’s implementations demonstrate the power of well-designed feedback loops. Their systems allow analysts to flag both false positives and false negatives, provide context about why certain connections are meaningful or meaningless, and suggest new patterns for the system to consider. This feedback is systematically reviewed and incorporated into system improvements.",

Organizations must help employees understand that AI tools are meant to enhance their capabilities, not replace them. This often requires active effort to counter fears and misconceptions about AI.\nWhen Starbucks implemented AI tools for inventory management and scheduling, they emphasized how the technology would free baristas from administrative tasks to focus on customer interaction and craft beverages. This positive framing helped overcome initial resistance and accelerated adoption.\nContinuous training supports this cultural shift. As AI capabilities evolve, users need ongoing training to make effective use of new features and capabilities. This training should focus on judgment and decision-making rather than just technical operation. Organizations that invest in this ongoing development typically see higher returns on their AI investments.\nRegular review and adjustment complete the implementation cycle. Periodically reviewing the implementation’s effectiveness against its goals reveals areas where the balance between automation and enhancement needs adjustment. This iterative approach recognizes that finding the optimal human-AI collaboration requires continuous refinement.",

Vector databases, for example, are emerging as a crucial tool for enhancing human search and discovery capabilities. These systems don’t replace human judgment but rather augment it by making conceptual connections that might otherwise be missed.\nHowever, the fundamental principle remains: successful implementation requires keeping humans central to the process. As one senior technology executive noted, “The goal isn’t to make the AI smarter, but to make the human-AI collaboration more effective.”\nThis principle extends beyond mere oversight; it recognizes that human judgment, intuition, and accountability are essential elements of effective decision-making. The most successful AI implementations maintain what critics have called “seeing the human doing it” - the visible presence of human judgment and accountability in key decisions.\nThink of the creative industries, where AI tools are increasingly common but rarely trusted to work autonomously. The attempt to use AI to complete Beethoven’s unfinished tenth symphony, which we discussed in detail in Chapter 8, demonstrates this principle. While the AI could generate music that superficially resembled Beethoven’s style, critics and audiences alike found it lacking the essential human element that makes great art compelling.",

This insight should guide both investment decisions and implementation strategies.\nWhen evaluating AI investments, look beyond technical capabilities to assess how effectively the company addresses the human element in implementation. Does the company have a clear enhancement framework? Do they emphasize transparency and explainability? Have they developed effective training approaches for users? Do they have mechanisms for continuous improvement based on human feedback?\nThe most promising investments often come not from companies pursuing the most advanced AI capabilities but from those that most effectively integrate AI with human judgment and expertise.

Organizations that master this shift, keeping humans central while leveraging AI’s capabilities, will be best positioned to create sustainable value in the AI era.\nThe challenge isn’t primarily technical - it’s organizational and human. Success requires careful attention to human factors, clear frameworks for collaboration, and a commitment to enhancing rather than replacing human capabilities. As AI continues to evolve, this human-centric approach to implementation will become increasingly crucial for organizational success.\nBy following the implementation principles outlined in this chapter - starting with human judgment, designing for transparency, integrating gradually, establishing clear boundaries, and building feedback loops - organizations can avoid the common pitfalls that plague many AI initiatives and instead develop systems that truly enhance human capabilities.\nThe future belongs not to organizations that deploy the most sophisticated AI systems but to those that most effectively combine artificial and human intelligence, creating systems that are more powerful than either could be alone. This is the true promise of AI enhancement - and the key to successful implementation.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "8.1 The Beethoven Challenge\nWe now have mentioned the Beethoven experiment several times because it is at the center of the theme in this book. An all-star team of musicologists, historians, and AI programmers attempted something unprecedented: completing Beethoven’s unfinished Tenth Symphony using artificial intelligence. By the reckoning of most experts, they ultimately failed to create a new version of the great composer’s work. From our perspective, this project offers valuable insights into both the capabilities and limitations of AI in creative work, while illuminating why human authenticity remains irreplaceable even as AI capabilities advance.\nBeethoven left the world with nine completed symphonies and a handful of musical sketches for a tenth. For centuries, these fragments tantalized musicians and scholars, hinting at what might have been. The AI team at Playform AI saw an opportunity: they would train their models on Beethoven’s complete works, use the sketches as a foundation, and generate what they believed would be a plausible completion of the Tenth Symphony.\nOn paper, this appeared to be an ideal AI project. The team had:\nIf AI could successfully complete this task, it would demonstrate remarkable creative capabilities. The result would be more than just a technical achievement – it would show that AI could authentically channel human genius.",

    "text": "8.2 The Results: Technical Success, Artistic Failure\nThe resulting symphony is technically impressive. To an untrained ear, it sounds plausibly like classical music. The notes follow reasonable progressions, the orchestration is proper, and there are moments that sound distinctly Beethoven-esque. Yet something crucial is missing.\nAs Beethoven scholar Jan Swafford noted in his review, the work is “aimless and uninspired.” The missing element isn’t technical proficiency – it’s the human struggle for excellence, the creative tension that produces true artistic breakthrough. This reveals a fundamental truth about AI that extends far beyond music: technical competence is not the same as authentic creation.",

    "text": "8.3 The Role of Human Struggle\nSwafford’s critique points to something deeper about human creativity: “We humans need to see the human doing it: Willie Mays making the catch that doesn’t look possible. When it comes to art, we need to see a woman or a man struggling with the universal mediocrity that is the natural lot of all of us and somehow out of some mélange of talent, skill, and luck doing the impossible.”\nThis insight helps explain why even technically perfect AI creations often feel hollow. Consider:\n\nThe Value of Imperfection: Beethoven’s own sketches were often mundane and uninspired. It was through sustained effort and refinement that he transformed ordinary musical ideas into extraordinary compositions. The process itself – the human struggle – is part of what we value.\nQuality Discrimination: Training AI on all of Beethoven’s works presents another challenge: Beethoven himself sometimes wrote mediocre pieces when working on commission. The AI cannot distinguish between his masterpieces and his mere commercial work. It lacks the human judgment to separate the transcendent from the ordinary.\nEmotional Connection: The audience’s knowledge that a human created the work is part of the work’s meaning. We connect with art partly because we know another human being struggled to create it.",

Here are some parallels:\n\n8.4.1 Sports and Entertainment\nThe same dynamic explains why robotic sports would never generate the passion of human athletics. When Colombian and Argentine soccer fans stormed Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium to see Lionel Messi play, they weren’t just seeking to witness technical excellence – they wanted to see human brilliance in action. No matter how technically sophisticated, robots playing soccer would never generate such emotional investment.\n\n\n8.4.2 Business Leadership\nIn corporate settings, technically correct decisions aren’t always the best decisions. Leaders need to be seen making difficult choices, wrestling with uncertainty, and taking responsibility for outcomes. An AI might make statistically optimal decisions, but it cannot provide the human element that builds trust and inspires teams.\n\n\n8.4.3 Professional Services\nEven in fields where technical expertise is paramount – law, medicine, financial advice – clients need to see human judgment at work. They need to know that a human professional has wrestled with their unique situation and exercised judgment on their behalf.",

Organizations that understand this will: - Keep humans visibly involved in key creative and decision-making processes - Use AI to augment rather than replace human judgment - Maintain transparency about the role of AI in their processes - Invest in developing human creativity and judgment alongside AI capabilities\nThe lesson from Beethoven’s Tenth is clear: technical proficiency, even at a very high level, is not enough. The human exception – the visible struggle for excellence, the exercise of judgment, the emotional connection – remains irreplaceable. This insight should guide how we implement AI across industries and applications.\nSuccess in an AI-enhanced world doesn’t mean replacing human creativity and judgment with artificial intelligence. Instead, it means finding ways to use AI that preserve and amplify the human elements that create true value. The goal should be to let AI handle the technical “how” while humans focus on the essential “what” – the judgment, creativity, and authentic connection that only humans can provide.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "9.1 The What-How Investment Landscape\nThe investment implications of artificial intelligence extend far beyond the obvious beneficiaries in Silicon Valley. While companies like Nvidia have captured headlines with astronomical returns, the real opportunity lies in identifying businesses that effectively leverage AI to enhance rather than replace human capabilities. This nuanced view requires looking past the hype to understand how AI actually creates sustainable competitive advantages.\nThe distinction between “what” and “how” intelligence provides a powerful framework for understanding investment opportunities in the AI era. While much of the market’s attention has focused on pure AI plays and dramatic automation narratives, the reality emerging from successful implementations suggests a more nuanced landscape—one where value accrues to companies that effectively leverage both domains rather than emphasizing one at the expense of the other.\nThis framework moves beyond simplistic replacement narratives to identify where sustainable competitive advantages are likely to emerge. As we’ve explored throughout this book, AI excels at executing the “how”—implementing well-defined processes and handling computational complexity—while humans maintain advantages in the “what”—determining strategic direction, exercising judgment, and framing problems effectively. The investment opportunities created by this division extend far beyond the obvious technology players to include companies across sectors that successfully integrate these complementary capabilities.\nThe investment landscape emerging from the what-how divide falls into three primary categories, each with distinct value propositions and competitive dynamics.\nFirst, “How Specialists” create value by transforming implementation capabilities across industries. These companies develop the infrastructure and tools that enable AI to execute with unprecedented efficiency and scale. The most obvious examples include semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia, whose specialized chips dramatically accelerate AI computations, and cloud computing platforms that provide the infrastructure for deploying AI at scale. But this category extends beyond hardware to include companies developing specialized AI tools for particular implementation domains—from code generation to image processing to natural language production.\nThe competitive advantages in this category derive from scale economies, network effects, and technical leadership. Nvidia’s dominance, for instance, extends beyond its hardware capabilities to encompass its CUDA software ecosystem, which creates powerful switching costs for developers. Similarly, cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud build advantages through integrated AI services that simplify implementation for enterprise customers.\nSecond, “What Enablers” focus on enhancing human strategic decision-making rather than replacing it. These companies develop tools and platforms that augment human judgment by processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and generating insights that inform strategic decisions. Examples include companies like Palantir, whose platforms help human analysts make sense of complex data environments, and decision support tools in healthcare that help doctors identify potential diagnoses while preserving their clinical judgment.\nCompetitive advantages for What Enablers tend to be more domain-specific, deriving from deep understanding of particular decision contexts, accumulated data assets, and the ability to effectively interface between AI capabilities and human judgment. The most successful companies in this category don’t merely provide raw analytical capabilities; they package insights in ways that meaningfully enhance human decision-making within specific contexts.\nThird, “Integration Masters” successfully bridge both domains, creating seamless connections between human strategic direction and AI-powered implementation. These companies—often enhanced incumbents rather than pure AI plays—leverage artificial intelligence to amplify existing competitive advantages rather than creating entirely new business models. They maintain human judgment in areas where it adds most value while deploying AI to handle implementation complexity at unprecedented scale and consistency.\nJPMorgan exemplifies this approach in financial services, using AI to process vast amounts of transaction data and flag potential issues while maintaining human judgment for complex risk assessments and client relationships. Similarly, Mayo Clinic enhances radiologist capabilities through AI that processes medical images while preserving physician judgment for diagnosis and treatment decisions.\nThe most sustainable competitive advantages often emerge in this third category, where companies create integrated capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate. While individual AI technologies might be widely available, the effective integration of these capabilities with domain-specific human expertise creates moats that prove remarkably durable.",

    "section": "9.2 Value Creation Through the What-How Lens",
    "text": "9.2 Value Creation Through the What-How Lens\nCompanies that effectively navigate the what-how divide demonstrate distinct performance advantages across several key metrics—creating investment signals that savvy investors can leverage to identify future winners.\nFirst, productivity metrics reveal the efficiency gains from appropriate division of labor between humans and AI. Rather than simply automating to reduce headcount, successful implementations redirect human cognitive capacity toward higher-value activities while leveraging AI for routine execution. This shows up in metrics like revenue per employee, which typically increases 30-40% within 3-5 years of effective implementation—significantly outpacing the 15-20% improvements from pure automation approaches.\nThe way that Bloomberg has evolved its financial terminal business is a case in point. Rather than simply automating financial analysis, they’ve used AI to process vast amounts of market data while keeping humans focused on identifying relevant patterns and developing investment insights. The result is dramatically higher productivity per analyst while maintaining the high-touch service that justifies premium pricing.\nSecond, capital efficiency improves through more targeted technology investments. Companies that understand the what-how distinction tend to make smaller, more focused AI investments with clearer payback periods rather than massive infrastructure projects with uncertain returns. This shows up in metrics like return on invested capital (ROIC), which typically remains 800-1200 basis points above cost of capital for companies pursuing balanced enhancement strategies—roughly double the premium for those focused solely on automation.\nGoldman Sachs’ approach to AI investment exemplifies this efficiency. Rather than attempting to automate their entire investment process, they’ve made targeted investments in specific capabilities—like natural language processing for earnings calls and sentiment analysis for news events—while maintaining human judgment for investment decisions. This focused approach has delivered clearer returns than competitors pursuing more sweeping AI transformations.\nThird, customer relationships strengthen when companies enhance rather than replace human elements in their service delivery. This manifests in metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer retention rates, and share of wallet—all of which tend to be significantly higher for companies that maintain appropriate human involvement in customer-facing roles while leveraging AI for background processes.\nThe contrast between different approaches to wealth management automation illustrates this dynamic clearly. The first wave of robo-advisors attempted to completely automate investment management, promising lower fees through elimination of human advisors. While they achieved some success in basic portfolio allocation, they struggled to retain high-net-worth clients who value human judgment in complex financial planning. In contrast, firms that deployed AI to enhance their human advisors’ capabilities—providing better analytics, freeing time for client relationships, enabling more sophisticated planning—have seen superior results across key relationship metrics.\nFourth, competitive advantages prove more sustainable when built on the integration of AI capabilities with human expertise rather than technology alone. While pure technology advantages typically erode as innovations disseminate, the combination of AI implementation with domain-specific human judgment creates integrated capabilities that competitors struggle to replicate. This sustainability shows up in metrics like gross margin stability and market share retention over time.\nLVMH’s application of AI in luxury retail demonstrates this sustainability. Rather than eliminating human sales associates, they’ve deployed AI to enhance personalization capabilities and inventory management while maintaining the high-touch human service that luxury customers expect. The resulting combination has proven remarkably difficult for competitors to match, allowing the company to maintain premium pricing and market leadership even as technology proliferates.\nFinally, regulatory risk decreases when companies maintain appropriate human oversight and accountability. As regulatory frameworks for AI continue to evolve, companies that preserve human judgment in critical decisions face substantially lower compliance burdens and fewer regulatory incidents than those pursuing full automation. This risk differential shows up directly in compliance costs, which average 30-40% lower for companies pursuing balanced human-AI strategies.",

    "section": "9.3 The What-How Integration Matrix",
    "text": "9.3 The What-How Integration Matrix\nTo visualize these dynamics, we propose a framework called the “What-How Integration Matrix” that maps companies based on their capabilities in both domains. This matrix helps investors identify where particular organizations fall within the landscape and evaluate their potential for sustainable value creation.\n\nThe vertical axis represents capabilities in the “what” domain—the ability to frame problems effectively, exercise contextual judgment, and set strategic direction. Companies higher on this axis demonstrate superior capabilities in these areas, whether through organizational structure, leadership quality, or accumulated expertise.\nThe horizontal axis represents capabilities in the “how” domain—the ability to implement efficiently at scale through AI and related technologies. Companies further to the right on this axis have more sophisticated implementation capabilities, whether through technical infrastructure, data assets, or algorithmic sophistication.\nThis creates four quadrants, each with distinct investment implications:\nIn the upper right quadrant are “Full-Spectrum Leaders”—companies with strong capabilities in both domains. These organizations effectively leverage AI for implementation while maintaining strong human judgment in strategic areas. Examples include JPMorgan in financial services, Mayo Clinic in healthcare, and Microsoft in enterprise software. These companies typically deliver superior financial performance across multiple metrics and maintain sustainable competitive advantages. They represent the most attractive long-term investments in the AI landscape.\nIn the upper left quadrant are “Strategic Leaders, Implementation Laggards”—companies with strong strategic capabilities but underdeveloped AI implementation. These organizations maintain valuable human judgment but haven’t yet leveraged AI effectively to execute at scale. Examples include many traditional consulting firms and creative agencies. These companies represent potential turnaround opportunities if they can successfully develop implementation capabilities while preserving their strategic strengths.\nIn the lower right quadrant are “Implementation Leaders, Strategic Laggards”—companies with sophisticated AI capabilities but underdeveloped strategic judgment. These organizations execute efficiently at scale but struggle with determining what’s worth doing in the first place. Examples include many pure-play AI startups and early-stage technology companies. These companies often deliver impressive technical results but struggle with sustainable business models. They represent higher-risk investments that might deliver breakthroughs but face significant strategic challenges.\nIn the lower left quadrant are “Dual Laggards”—companies with weak capabilities in both domains. These organizations neither leverage AI effectively nor maintain distinctive human judgment. They represent the least attractive investment opportunities and face existential threats as competition intensifies.\nThe most successful companies typically follow an upward trajectory through this matrix over time, either by enhancing their “what” capabilities through organizational development or by improving their “how” capabilities through technological investment. Understanding where companies fall on this matrix—and how they’re evolving—provides invaluable insight for investment decisions.",

    "section": "9.4 Industry-Specific Applications",
    "text": "9.4 Industry-Specific Applications\nThe what-how framework manifests differently across industries, creating distinct investment opportunities in each sector.\nIn financial services, the divide appears most clearly between strategic risk assessment and transaction execution. Companies like BlackRock have leveraged this distinction effectively, using AI to handle routine trading operations and data analysis while maintaining human judgment for portfolio construction and risk management. Their Aladdin platform exemplifies this approach, providing sophisticated analytical capabilities while preserving human oversight for strategic decisions. The result has been dramatic growth in assets under management while maintaining impressive margins.\nThe contrast with pure algorithmic trading firms is instructive. While many quantitative hedge funds have delivered impressive short-term results through AI-driven strategies, they’ve also demonstrated greater volatility and vulnerability to market shifts that fall outside their training data. The most sustainable advantages have emerged not from pure automation but from firms that effectively combine algorithmic execution with human judgment about market conditions and risk factors.\nIn healthcare, the divide manifests between diagnostic judgment and data processing. Companies like Tempus have built successful models by enhancing physician capabilities rather than attempting to replace them. Their platform analyzes vast amounts of clinical and molecular data to identify potential treatment options while maintaining doctor judgment for diagnosis and treatment selection. This approach has enabled them to build a sustainable business model with strong hospital relationships that pure automation plays have struggled to match.\nThe pharmaceutical industry demonstrates similar dynamics. Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals use AI to dramatically accelerate drug discovery processes that would be impossible for humans to execute manually, while maintaining scientific judgment about which compounds merit further investigation. This combination has enabled them to build a more capital-efficient drug discovery model than either traditional pharma companies or pure AI startups.\nIn manufacturing, the divide appears between design creativity and production optimization. Companies like NVIDIA have mastered this distinction not just in their products but in their own operations. They leverage AI extensively in chip design and production processes while maintaining human creativity in architectural decisions and strategic direction. This combination has enabled them to maintain technical leadership while achieving unprecedented scale.\nBMW’s implementation of AI in manufacturing quality control demonstrates similar principles. Their systems process visual inspection data at scale and consistency impossible for humans, while maintaining human judgment for determining which deviations matter in different contexts. The result has been dramatic improvements in quality metrics while maintaining the distinctive characteristics that define their brand.\nIn creative industries, the divide manifests between artistic vision and technical execution. Companies like Pixar exemplify this approach, using increasingly sophisticated AI tools for rendering and animation while preserving human creativity for storytelling and character development. This combination has enabled them to create films of increasing technical sophistication while maintaining the emotional resonance that drives commercial success.\nAdobe has followed a similar path with their Creative Cloud suite, integrating increasingly powerful AI capabilities while preserving space for human creative direction. Their Generative Fill features, for instance, handle technical execution that would be tedious for humans while keeping designers in control of creative vision. This approach has enabled them to maintain premium pricing and market leadership despite increasing competition.",

    "section": "9.5 Investment Strategy Implications",
    "text": "9.5 Investment Strategy Implications\nThe what-how framework suggests several key principles for AI-related investment strategies:\nFirst, focus on integration capabilities rather than pure AI technology. The most sustainable advantages emerge not from technical leadership in isolation but from effective integration of AI capabilities with domain-specific human expertise. Companies that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of the appropriate boundaries between human and AI responsibilities typically outperform pure technology plays over the long term.\nSecond, evaluate leadership understanding of the what-how distinction. Companies whose executives can clearly articulate where human judgment adds value versus where AI can handle implementation typically demonstrate superior implementation results. This understanding shows up in organizational structure, talent development approaches, and capital allocation decisions.\nThird, assess data assets and implementation capabilities realistically. While many companies tout their AI initiatives, the reality often falls short of the rhetoric. Investors should look for concrete evidence of implementation success—clear use cases, measurable results, and realistic assessments of both capabilities and limitations.\nFourth, consider timing and geographic diversification. Different industries and regions are at different stages of AI adoption, creating opportunities to identify leaders in emerging domains before full market recognition. This requires careful attention to adoption curves and industry-specific implementation challenges.\nFifth, monitor regulatory developments through the what-how lens. Regulatory frameworks increasingly distinguish between different levels of automation and human oversight. Companies that maintain appropriate human involvement in critical decisions typically face lower regulatory burdens than those pursuing full automation strategies.\nThe most attractive investments typically demonstrate several characteristics: clear understanding of where human judgment adds value, sophisticated AI implementation in appropriate domains, strong data assets and implementation capabilities, realistic assessment of both opportunities and limitations, and organizational structures that effectively bridge the what-how divide.",

    "text": "9.6 Conclusion: Value Creation and Capture in the AI Era\nThe investment implications of the what-how framework extend far beyond the current AI hype cycle. While today’s market enthusiasm often focuses on pure technology plays and dramatic automation narratives, the sustainable advantages are likely to accrue to companies that effectively integrate AI capabilities with human judgment rather than emphasizing one at the expense of the other.\nThis pattern echoes previous technological revolutions. During the rise of the internet, early enthusiasm concentrated on pure-play dot-com companies promising to revolutionize entire industries. Yet the most enduring value ultimately accrued to organizations that effectively integrated internet capabilities with existing business models and domain expertise—companies like Amazon, which combined e-commerce technology with sophisticated logistics operations and merchandising judgment.\nSimilarly, the most sustainable AI-driven value creation will likely come from companies that effectively leverage artificial intelligence for implementation while preserving human judgment in domains where it adds distinctive value. These companies may not capture today’s headlines, but they’re positioned to deliver superior long-term performance as the technology matures and competitive differentiation shifts from pure AI capabilities to effective integration.\nThe future belongs not to those who build the most sophisticated AI systems in isolation, but to those who most effectively combine artificial and human intelligence to create integrated capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate. Understanding this fundamental truth—and identifying the companies that embody it—represents the central investment opportunity of the AI era.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1 The “What-How” Imperative\nThroughout this book, we’ve examined how artificial intelligence enhances rather than replaces human capabilities across industries. As we look toward the future, the critical question isn’t whether AI will automate jobs away, but how we can build systems that amplify human judgment while preserving human agency. This final chapter outlines concrete steps for business leaders, policymakers, and individuals to ensure AI development remains human-centric.\nThe narrative around AI has focused excessively on automation and replacement, leading to misallocation of resources and flawed implementation strategies. Our research across industries reveals that successful AI deployments invariably preserve human judgment while delegating technical execution to machines. This division mirrors the fundamental “what-how” distinction we’ve explored throughout this book: humans determine what needs to be done, while AI increasingly handles how to do it.\nConsider the evolution of automated trading systems in financial markets. Early attempts at fully autonomous trading frequently resulted in catastrophic failures when market conditions deviated from historical patterns. Today’s most successful trading operations combine AI’s pattern recognition capabilities with human traders’ contextual understanding and risk assessment. The machines excel at identifying opportunities and executing trades (the “how”), but humans remain essential for setting strategy and assessing market psychology (the “what”).\nThis pattern repeats across industries. In healthcare, AI excels at analyzing medical images and identifying potential anomalies (the “how”), but doctors provide crucial judgment in determining what these findings mean within the broader context of patient health (the “what”). In creative fields, AI tools can generate endless variations of designs or content (the “how”), but human creators remain essential for determining which outputs align with strategic objectives and audience needs (the “what”).",

    "section": "10.2 The Managerial Mindset",
    "text": "10.2 The Managerial Mindset\nThis shift toward human determination of “what” requires a fundamental transformation in how individuals approach their work. In essence, AI is turning everyone into managers. Just as traditional managers delegate execution to team members while retaining responsibility for direction and strategy, knowledge workers increasingly need to delegate execution to AI while maintaining control over objectives and vision.\nThis transition demands a “managerial mindset”—the ability to define clear objectives, break complex tasks into component parts, evaluate outputs against strategic goals, balance efficiency with quality, and think systemically about unintended consequences. These capabilities have traditionally been developed through years of management experience. Now, they’re becoming essential for individual contributors across industries.\nThe most successful professionals won’t be those who execute tasks most efficiently, but those who define problems most effectively and leverage AI to implement solutions. For example, marketing professionals who once spent hours crafting social media posts must now think more strategically about audience segments, messaging strategy, and brand consistency, while delegating content generation to AI tools. The value shifts from copywriting skill to strategic judgment.",

    "text": "10.3 Rethinking AI Implementation\nBusiness leaders must shift their AI implementation strategies away from automation-first approaches toward enhancement-focused frameworks. This requires starting with human decision processes rather than technical capabilities, building trust through transparent division of labor, and investing in managerial capabilities across the organization.\nGoldman Sachs has embraced this approach in its investment research operations. Rather than replacing analysts with automated systems, they’ve implemented AI tools that process vast amounts of financial data, identifying patterns and anomalies for human review. The AI handles the computational complexity (the “how”), while human analysts maintain responsibility for interpretation and strategic recommendations (the “what”). This has allowed the firm to increase both the breadth and depth of its research while maintaining the human judgment clients value.\nThe human exception in this example isn’t a superficial addition—it’s fundamental to the system’s success. By maintaining human determination of what matters in financial analysis, Goldman preserves the contextual understanding and strategic judgment that clients truly value, while leveraging AI’s computational capabilities to enhance analytical depth.",

    "section": "10.4 Educational Transformation",
    "text": "10.4 Educational Transformation\nThe shift toward managerial thinking demands fundamental changes in education and professional development. Traditional education has focused heavily on developing “how” skills—teaching specific methodologies, tools, and techniques. Future-oriented education must emphasize “what” capabilities: problem framing, strategic thinking, and contextual judgment.\nThis doesn’t mean technical skills become irrelevant—foundational knowledge remains essential for effective delegation. You can’t effectively direct AI without understanding the domain you’re working in. But the emphasis shifts from memorization and execution to conceptual understanding and strategic application.\nHarvard Business School has begun adapting its curriculum to address this shift. Rather than teaching students to perform financial analyses manually, they now focus on helping students understand when different analytical approaches are appropriate and how to interpret results in strategic contexts. The technical execution is increasingly delegated to software, while human judgment about application and interpretation becomes the focus.\nSimilar transformations are needed at all educational levels. Secondary schools must move beyond teaching students to execute algorithms and instead help them understand when different approaches are appropriate. Professional education needs to emphasize strategic thinking and judgment rather than tool proficiency. The goal should be developing individuals who can effectively direct artificial intelligence rather than compete with it.",

    "text": "10.5 Policy Imperatives\nPolicymakers face the challenge of fostering AI innovation while ensuring its development serves human interests. Based on the “what-how” framework, we propose that regulations should preserve human determination of “what” by requiring meaningful human oversight of strategic decisions. Critical domains like healthcare and finance should maintain clear boundaries between machine execution and human judgment, and policies should protect against gradual erosion of human agency through excessive automation.\nPromoting transparency in the division of labor is equally important. AI systems should clearly communicate their limitations and confidence levels, organizations should document which decisions remain under human control, and interfaces should make it clear when users are interacting with AI versus humans. These measures help maintain the human element in decision-making by ensuring people understand where their judgment remains essential.\nJapan’s approach to industrial automation offers instructive lessons. Rather than focusing exclusively on replacing human workers, Japanese manufacturers have emphasized “human-centered automation” that enhances worker capabilities while maintaining human judgment in critical decisions. This has allowed them to achieve high productivity while preserving employment and maintaining quality.",

    "text": "10.6 Individual Adaptation Strategies\nFor individuals navigating this shifting landscape, developing a managerial mindset becomes crucial. This means focusing on problem definition rather than execution, building contextual knowledge that transcends specific tools, practicing effective delegation to AI systems, and cultivating judgment through varied experiences.\nSoftware developers who have embraced this approach report significant productivity gains while maintaining control of strategic direction. Rather than writing code line by line, they focus on system architecture and user needs, delegating implementation details to AI coding assistants. This allows them to create more sophisticated applications while spending more time understanding user requirements and less time on repetitive coding tasks.\nThese developers embody the human element in AI-enhanced work: they contribute not through technical execution, which increasingly belongs to machines, but through judgment about what to build and why. Their value comes from understanding user needs, designing coherent systems, and making strategic trade-offs—all capabilities that require human contextual understanding.",

    "text": "10.7 Investment Implications\nFor investors and business leaders, the “what-how” framework offers valuable guidance for capital allocation. Organizations most likely to succeed in an AI-enhanced economy are those that invest in developing strategic capabilities throughout the organization, create clear interfaces between human judgment and AI execution, and build cultures that value strategic thinking at all levels.\nCompanies that emphasize full automation without preserving space for human judgment typically achieve short-term cost savings at the expense of long-term competitiveness. The most successful implementations maintain “human centrality”—keeping humans at the center of strategic decision-making while leveraging AI for execution.\nThe human element in these successful companies isn’t peripheral—it’s central to their competitive advantage. In an age where technical execution increasingly becomes commoditized through AI, human judgment about strategic direction becomes the primary differentiator between organizations.",

    "text": "10.8 Looking Forward: The Human Element\nThe shift toward managerial thinking represents more than a tactical response to AI advancement—it reflects a fundamental evolution in how humans create value. Throughout history, technological revolutions have consistently shifted human contribution up the value chain, from physical labor to knowledge work, and now to judgment and direction.\nThis doesn’t mean fewer jobs overall, but rather a transformation in the nature of work. Just as previous technological shifts created entirely new categories of employment, the AI revolution will likely generate roles we cannot yet imagine—but they will almost certainly emphasize human judgment, creativity, and direction rather than technical execution.\nThe organizations that thrive in this environment will be those that develop what Peter Drucker called “knowledge executives”—individuals at all levels who take responsibility not just for doing work but for defining what work should be done. The educational institutions that succeed will be those that shift from teaching execution to developing judgment. And the societies that prosper will be those that invest in the distinctly human capabilities that AI cannot replicate.\nThe future belongs not to those who execute tasks most efficiently, but to those who determine which tasks are worth doing in the first place. By embracing this managerial mindset and building systems that enhance rather than replace human judgment, we can create a future where artificial intelligence truly serves human flourishing.\nThis, ultimately, is the human element in the AI revolution: not the physical presence of people in workflows, but the preservation of human judgment in determining what matters. As AI increasingly handles the “how,” the essence of humanity—our ability to determine “what” deserves attention and why—becomes more valuable, not less. The human element isn’t just an addition to AI systems; it’s what gives them purpose and direction. In the AI-enhanced future, the most important contribution we make won’t be execution but decision—not how, but what.\n\n\n\n\nAbdin, Marah, Sam Ade Jacobs, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Jyoti Aneja, Ahmed Awadallah, Hany Awadalla, Nguyen Bach, et al. 2024. “Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219.\n\n\nAI, 01, Alex Young, Bei Chen, Chao Li, Chengen Huang, Ge Zhang, Guanwei Zhang, et al. 2024. “Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI.” arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652.\n\n\nAlamdari, Sarah, Nitya Thakkar, Rianne Van Den Berg, Alex Xijie Lu, Nicolo Fusi, Ava Pardis Amini, and Kevin K Yang. 2023. “Protein Generation with Evolutionary Diffusion: Sequence Is All You Need.” Preprint.

    "text": "Building the Future: A Human-Centric Vision for AI\nThroughout this book, we’ve explored why artificial intelligence will enhance rather than replace human capabilities. As we conclude, it’s crucial to examine what this means for building a human-centric AI future.\nThe pattern that emerges from decades of technology implementation is clear: the most successful deployments are those that augment human capabilities rather than attempt to replicate them. This remains fundamentally true with AI. The challenge of self-driving cars illustrates this perfectly. The core difficulty isn’t processing power or sensor technology – it’s replicating the intuitive judgment that allows human drivers to anticipate potential dangers before they materialize.\nThis principle extends across industries. While AI excels at processing vast amounts of medical images or financial data, it cannot replace a doctor’s holistic understanding of patient health or an investor’s grasp of how geopolitical events might affect market psychology. The future lies not in pursuing full automation, but in finding the sweet spot where AI enhances human judgment.\nThe financial sector provides compelling evidence for this enhancement thesis. The most successful AI implementations in finance aren’t the fully automated trading systems that attempt to replace human traders. Instead, they’re the tools that help analysts process information more quickly, allowing them to focus their human judgment on higher-level strategy and risk assessment. JPMorgan’s ChatCFO exemplifies this approach – rather than replacing financial analysts, it serves as a powerful tool that allows them to process vast amounts of financial data more efficiently. The human analysts remain essential for interpreting results and making strategic recommendations.\nThis leads to a crucial insight about AI implementation. The key question isn’t “what tasks can AI perform?” but rather “how can AI enhance human capabilities?” This requires a fundamental shift in how we think about AI development and deployment. Organizations need to move beyond the simple automation mindset. Instead of asking “can AI do this job?”, they should ask “how can AI help humans do this job better?” This might mean using AI to handle routine tasks while freeing humans to focus on judgment-intensive work, or using AI to process vast amounts of data while leaving the interpretation to human experts.\nThe investment implications are significant. Companies that understand this enhancement paradigm will likely outperform those pursuing full automation. We’re already seeing this in healthcare, where companies developing AI tools to assist doctors are showing more promise than those attempting to replace medical judgment entirely.\nLooking ahead, several principles should guide AI development:\nFor policymakers, this means creating frameworks that encourage responsible AI development while preserving human agency. This should include regulations requiring human oversight of critical AI systems, standards for AI transparency and explainability, investment in education and training programs that prepare workers for human-AI collaboration, and incentives for companies developing enhancement-focused AI applications.\nThe attempt to complete Beethoven’s tenth symphony using AI serves as a powerful metaphor for both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence. While the AI could generate music that superficially resembled Beethoven’s style, it couldn’t capture the spark of human creativity that made his work truly great. This illustrates a broader truth about AI: it’s at its best when enhancing human capabilities rather than trying to replace them. The future of AI lies not in replicating human intelligence but in amplifying it.\nAs we look to the future, the winners in the AI revolution will be those who understand this fundamental truth. Whether in finance, healthcare, creative industries, or any other sector, success will come from finding ways to combine human judgment with AI capabilities. The human exception isn’t just a feel-good addition to AI systems – it’s essential to their effectiveness. As we’ve shown throughout this book, keeping humans “in the loop” leads to better outcomes than pursuing full automation.\nThe AI revolution is indeed transformative, but not in the way many predict. Instead of a future where AI replaces human workers, we’re entering an era of enhancement, where human capabilities are amplified by artificial intelligence. Understanding and embracing this reality is crucial for anyone looking to thrive in the AI-enhanced future.",
