The investment implications of artificial intelligence extend far beyond the obvious beneficiaries in Silicon Valley. While companies like Nvidia have captured headlines with astronomical returns, the real opportunity lies in identifying businesses that effectively leverage AI to enhance rather than replace human capabilities. This nuanced view requires looking past the hype to understand how AI actually creates sustainable competitive advantages.


The distinction between "what" and "how" intelligence provides a powerful framework for understanding investment opportunities in the AI era. While much of the market's attention has focused on pure AI plays and dramatic automation narratives, the reality emerging from successful implementations suggests a more nuanced landscape—one where value accrues to companies that effectively leverage both domains rather than emphasizing one at the expense of the other.

This framework moves beyond simplistic replacement narratives to identify where sustainable competitive advantages are likely to emerge. As we've explored throughout this book, AI excels at executing the "how"—implementing well-defined processes and handling computational complexity—while humans maintain advantages in the "what"—determining strategic direction, exercising judgment, and framing problems effectively. The investment opportunities created by this division extend far beyond the obvious technology players to include companies across sectors that successfully integrate these complementary capabilities.

## The What-How Investment Landscape

The investment landscape emerging from the what-how divide falls into three primary categories, each with distinct value propositions and competitive dynamics.

First, "How Specialists" create value by transforming implementation capabilities across industries. These companies develop the infrastructure and tools that enable AI to execute with unprecedented efficiency and scale. The most obvious examples include semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia, whose specialized chips dramatically accelerate AI computations, and cloud computing platforms that provide the infrastructure for deploying AI at scale. But this category extends beyond hardware to include companies developing specialized AI tools for particular implementation domains—from code generation to image processing to natural language production.

The competitive advantages in this category derive from scale economies, network effects, and technical leadership. Nvidia's dominance, for instance, extends beyond its hardware capabilities to encompass its CUDA software ecosystem, which creates powerful switching costs for developers. Similarly, cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud build advantages through integrated AI services that simplify implementation for enterprise customers.

Second, "What Enablers" focus on enhancing human strategic decision-making rather than replacing it. These companies develop tools and platforms that augment human judgment by processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and generating insights that inform strategic decisions. Examples include companies like Palantir, whose platforms help human analysts make sense of complex data environments, and decision support tools in healthcare that help doctors identify potential diagnoses while preserving their clinical judgment.

Competitive advantages for What Enablers tend to be more domain-specific, deriving from deep understanding of particular decision contexts, accumulated data assets, and the ability to effectively interface between AI capabilities and human judgment. The most successful companies in this category don't merely provide raw analytical capabilities; they package insights in ways that meaningfully enhance human decision-making within specific contexts.

Third, "Integration Masters" successfully bridge both domains, creating seamless connections between human strategic direction and AI-powered implementation. These companies—often enhanced incumbents rather than pure AI plays—leverage artificial intelligence to amplify existing competitive advantages rather than creating entirely new business models. They maintain human judgment in areas where it adds most value while deploying AI to handle implementation complexity at unprecedented scale and consistency.

JPMorgan exemplifies this approach in financial services, using AI to process vast amounts of transaction data and flag potential issues while maintaining human judgment for complex risk assessments and client relationships. Similarly, Mayo Clinic enhances radiologist capabilities through AI that processes medical images while preserving physician judgment for diagnosis and treatment decisions.

The most sustainable competitive advantages often emerge in this third category, where companies create integrated capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate. While individual AI technologies might be widely available, the effective integration of these capabilities with domain-specific human expertise creates moats that prove remarkably durable.

## Value Creation Through the What-How Lens

Companies that effectively navigate the what-how divide demonstrate distinct performance advantages across several key metrics—creating investment signals that savvy investors can leverage to identify future winners.

First, productivity metrics reveal the efficiency gains from appropriate division of labor between humans and AI. Rather than simply automating to reduce headcount, successful implementations redirect human cognitive capacity toward higher-value activities while leveraging AI for routine execution. This shows up in metrics like revenue per employee, which typically increases 30-40% within 3-5 years of effective implementation—significantly outpacing the 15-20% improvements from pure automation approaches.

The way that Bloomberg has evolved its financial terminal business is a case in point.  Rather than simply automating financial analysis, they've used AI to process vast amounts of market data while keeping humans focused on identifying relevant patterns and developing investment insights. The result is dramatically higher productivity per analyst while maintaining the high-touch service that justifies premium pricing.

Second, capital efficiency improves through more targeted technology investments. Companies that understand the what-how distinction tend to make smaller, more focused AI investments with clearer payback periods rather than massive infrastructure projects with uncertain returns. This shows up in metrics like return on invested capital (ROIC), which typically remains 800-1200 basis points above cost of capital for companies pursuing balanced enhancement strategies—roughly double the premium for those focused solely on automation.

Goldman Sachs' approach to AI investment exemplifies this efficiency. Rather than attempting to automate their entire investment process, they've made targeted investments in specific capabilities—like natural language processing for earnings calls and sentiment analysis for news events—while maintaining human judgment for investment decisions. This focused approach has delivered clearer returns than competitors pursuing more sweeping AI transformations.

Third, customer relationships strengthen when companies enhance rather than replace human elements in their service delivery. This manifests in metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer retention rates, and share of wallet—all of which tend to be significantly higher for companies that maintain appropriate human involvement in customer-facing roles while leveraging AI for background processes.

The contrast between different approaches to wealth management automation illustrates this dynamic clearly. The first wave of robo-advisors attempted to completely automate investment management, promising lower fees through elimination of human advisors. While they achieved some success in basic portfolio allocation, they struggled to retain high-net-worth clients who value human judgment in complex financial planning. In contrast, firms that deployed AI to enhance their human advisors' capabilities—providing better analytics, freeing time for client relationships, enabling more sophisticated planning—have seen superior results across key relationship metrics.

Fourth, competitive advantages prove more sustainable when built on the integration of AI capabilities with human expertise rather than technology alone. While pure technology advantages typically erode as innovations disseminate, the combination of AI implementation with domain-specific human judgment creates integrated capabilities that competitors struggle to replicate. This sustainability shows up in metrics like gross margin stability and market share retention over time.

LVMH's application of AI in luxury retail demonstrates this sustainability. Rather than eliminating human sales associates, they've deployed AI to enhance personalization capabilities and inventory management while maintaining the high-touch human service that luxury customers expect. The resulting combination has proven remarkably difficult for competitors to match, allowing the company to maintain premium pricing and market leadership even as technology proliferates.

Finally, regulatory risk decreases when companies maintain appropriate human oversight and accountability. As regulatory frameworks for AI continue to evolve, companies that preserve human judgment in critical decisions face substantially lower compliance burdens and fewer regulatory incidents than those pursuing full automation. This risk differential shows up directly in compliance costs, which average 30-40% lower for companies pursuing balanced human-AI strategies.

## The What-How Integration Matrix

To visualize these dynamics, we propose a framework called the "What-How Integration Matrix" that maps companies based on their capabilities in both domains. This matrix helps investors identify where particular organizations fall within the landscape and evaluate their potential for sustainable value creation.

![](_resources/images/Ch09-images/what-how-matrix-ch9.svg)

The vertical axis represents capabilities in the "what" domain—the ability to frame problems effectively, exercise contextual judgment, and set strategic direction. Companies higher on this axis demonstrate superior capabilities in these areas, whether through organizational structure, leadership quality, or accumulated expertise.

The horizontal axis represents capabilities in the "how" domain—the ability to implement efficiently at scale through AI and related technologies. Companies further to the right on this axis have more sophisticated implementation capabilities, whether through technical infrastructure, data assets, or algorithmic sophistication.

This creates four quadrants, each with distinct investment implications:

In the upper right quadrant are "Full-Spectrum Leaders"—companies with strong capabilities in both domains. These organizations effectively leverage AI for implementation while maintaining strong human judgment in strategic areas. Examples include JPMorgan in financial services, Mayo Clinic in healthcare, and Microsoft in enterprise software. These companies typically deliver superior financial performance across multiple metrics and maintain sustainable competitive advantages. They represent the most attractive long-term investments in the AI landscape.

In the upper left quadrant are "Strategic Leaders, Implementation Laggards"—companies with strong strategic capabilities but underdeveloped AI implementation. These organizations maintain valuable human judgment but haven't yet leveraged AI effectively to execute at scale. Examples include many traditional consulting firms and creative agencies. These companies represent potential turnaround opportunities if they can successfully develop implementation capabilities while preserving their strategic strengths.

In the lower right quadrant are "Implementation Leaders, Strategic Laggards"—companies with sophisticated AI capabilities but underdeveloped strategic judgment. These organizations execute efficiently at scale but struggle with determining what's worth doing in the first place. Examples include many pure-play AI startups and early-stage technology companies. These companies often deliver impressive technical results but struggle with sustainable business models. They represent higher-risk investments that might deliver breakthroughs but face significant strategic challenges.

In the lower left quadrant are "Dual Laggards"—companies with weak capabilities in both domains. These organizations neither leverage AI effectively nor maintain distinctive human judgment. They represent the least attractive investment opportunities and face existential threats as competition intensifies.

The most successful companies typically follow an upward trajectory through this matrix over time, either by enhancing their "what" capabilities through organizational development or by improving their "how" capabilities through technological investment. Understanding where companies fall on this matrix—and how they're evolving—provides invaluable insight for investment decisions.

## Industry-Specific Applications

The what-how framework manifests differently across industries, creating distinct investment opportunities in each sector.

In financial services, the divide appears most clearly between strategic risk assessment and transaction execution. Companies like BlackRock have leveraged this distinction effectively, using AI to handle routine trading operations and data analysis while maintaining human judgment for portfolio construction and risk management. Their Aladdin platform exemplifies this approach, providing sophisticated analytical capabilities while preserving human oversight for strategic decisions. The result has been dramatic growth in assets under management while maintaining impressive margins.

The contrast with pure algorithmic trading firms is instructive. While many quantitative hedge funds have delivered impressive short-term results through AI-driven strategies, they've also demonstrated greater volatility and vulnerability to market shifts that fall outside their training data. The most sustainable advantages have emerged not from pure automation but from firms that effectively combine algorithmic execution with human judgment about market conditions and risk factors.

In healthcare, the divide manifests between diagnostic judgment and data processing. Companies like Tempus have built successful models by enhancing physician capabilities rather than attempting to replace them. Their platform analyzes vast amounts of clinical and molecular data to identify potential treatment options while maintaining doctor judgment for diagnosis and treatment selection. This approach has enabled them to build a sustainable business model with strong hospital relationships that pure automation plays have struggled to match.

The pharmaceutical industry demonstrates similar dynamics. Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals use AI to dramatically accelerate drug discovery processes that would be impossible for humans to execute manually, while maintaining scientific judgment about which compounds merit further investigation. This combination has enabled them to build a more capital-efficient drug discovery model than either traditional pharma companies or pure AI startups.

In manufacturing, the divide appears between design creativity and production optimization. Companies like NVIDIA have mastered this distinction not just in their products but in their own operations. They leverage AI extensively in chip design and production processes while maintaining human creativity in architectural decisions and strategic direction. This combination has enabled them to maintain technical leadership while achieving unprecedented scale.

BMW's implementation of AI in manufacturing quality control demonstrates similar principles. Their systems process visual inspection data at scale and consistency impossible for humans, while maintaining human judgment for determining which deviations matter in different contexts. The result has been dramatic improvements in quality metrics while maintaining the distinctive characteristics that define their brand.

In creative industries, the divide manifests between artistic vision and technical execution. Companies like Pixar exemplify this approach, using increasingly sophisticated AI tools for rendering and animation while preserving human creativity for storytelling and character development. This combination has enabled them to create films of increasing technical sophistication while maintaining the emotional resonance that drives commercial success.

Adobe has followed a similar path with their Creative Cloud suite, integrating increasingly powerful AI capabilities while preserving space for human creative direction. Their Generative Fill features, for instance, handle technical execution that would be tedious for humans while keeping designers in control of creative vision. This approach has enabled them to maintain premium pricing and market leadership despite increasing competition.

## Investment Strategy Implications

The what-how framework suggests several key principles for AI-related investment strategies:

First, focus on integration capabilities rather than pure AI technology. The most sustainable advantages emerge not from technical leadership in isolation but from effective integration of AI capabilities with domain-specific human expertise. Companies that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of the appropriate boundaries between human and AI responsibilities typically outperform pure technology plays over the long term.

Second, evaluate leadership understanding of the what-how distinction. Companies whose executives can clearly articulate where human judgment adds value versus where AI can handle implementation typically demonstrate superior implementation results. This understanding shows up in organizational structure, talent development approaches, and capital allocation decisions.

Third, assess data assets and implementation capabilities realistically. While many companies tout their AI initiatives, the reality often falls short of the rhetoric. Investors should look for concrete evidence of implementation success—clear use cases, measurable results, and realistic assessments of both capabilities and limitations.

Fourth, consider timing and geographic diversification. Different industries and regions are at different stages of AI adoption, creating opportunities to identify leaders in emerging domains before full market recognition. This requires careful attention to adoption curves and industry-specific implementation challenges.

Fifth, monitor regulatory developments through the what-how lens. Regulatory frameworks increasingly distinguish between different levels of automation and human oversight. Companies that maintain appropriate human involvement in critical decisions typically face lower regulatory burdens than those pursuing full automation strategies.

The most attractive investments typically demonstrate several characteristics: clear understanding of where human judgment adds value, sophisticated AI implementation in appropriate domains, strong data assets and implementation capabilities, realistic assessment of both opportunities and limitations, and organizational structures that effectively bridge the what-how divide.

## Conclusion: Value Creation and Capture in the AI Era

The investment implications of the what-how framework extend far beyond the current AI hype cycle. While today's market enthusiasm often focuses on pure technology plays and dramatic automation narratives, the sustainable advantages are likely to accrue to companies that effectively integrate AI capabilities with human judgment rather than emphasizing one at the expense of the other.

This pattern echoes previous technological revolutions. During the rise of the internet, early enthusiasm concentrated on pure-play dot-com companies promising to revolutionize entire industries. Yet the most enduring value ultimately accrued to organizations that effectively integrated internet capabilities with existing business models and domain expertise—companies like Amazon, which combined e-commerce technology with sophisticated logistics operations and merchandising judgment.

Similarly, the most sustainable AI-driven value creation will likely come from companies that effectively leverage artificial intelligence for implementation while preserving human judgment in domains where it adds distinctive value. These companies may not capture today's headlines, but they're positioned to deliver superior long-term performance as the technology matures and competitive differentiation shifts from pure AI capabilities to effective integration.

The future belongs not to those who build the most sophisticated AI systems in isolation, but to those who most effectively combine artificial and human intelligence to create integrated capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate. Understanding this fundamental truth—and identifying the companies that embody it—represents the central investment opportunity of the AI era.
